# Summary


## Overview

**President Lula da Silva, inaugurated in January 2023, has prioritised the reconstruction of Brazil's environmental policy, emphasising low-carbon, socio-economic development. Brazil's forthcoming presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 also shows the country’s strengthened cooperation and re-engagement with the international community. In October 2023, Brazil** **reverted to its original** **NDC targets****, reflecting a renewed focus on combating deforestation. Initial reports indicate a 36% decrease in primary forest loss in 2023 compared to 2022 due to strengthened law enforcement.**

Domestically, Brazil has adopted new economy-wide policies to support sustainable development and job creation which highlights the government’s commitment to invest in infrastructure, industry and the transformation of the economy. While these policies include energy transition as one of their main pillars of action, Brazil is yet to have a fixed timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and will continue to allocate significant resources to the production and development of oil and fossil gas in the next decade, which raises concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil's infrastructure agenda. Expanding oil and fossil gas production contradicts the Paris Agreement's target and Brazil’s ambition to lead on climate action ahead of COP30. With this update, Brazil’s overall rating of its climate targets and actions remain rated “Insufficient”.

Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 target or its 2030. Brazil’s emissions under current policies (excluding the land use and land use change — or LULUCF — sector) have essentially plateaued, expected to only slightly grow over the rest of the decade. Yet, Brazil needs to peak and rapidly decrease emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C. Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors, including a reversal of present plans to expand the exploitation of fossil fuel energy sources.

Recent positive policy developments include:

- **The change in government** which is prioritising reconstructing the country’s environmental policy which had suffered from budget cuts and policy rollbacks in the past.
- **The resubmission of its NDC in October 2023,** followed by the ongoing process of reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035.
- **Deforestation rates falling** in response to political action as recent studies indicate a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels.
- **Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025** highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues.
- **The development of new policies** such as the Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE) to promote sustainable development while reducing Brazil’s overall environmental footprint, and which includes energy transition as one of its six pillars of action.
To improve its climate targets and action rating, Brazil could:

- **Submit a new and significantly more ambitious NDC** which clearly outlines the different sectors' contributions to the mitigation target, in particular that of the LULUCF sector. The National Climate Change Policy, currently under development and which will include sectoral mitigation strategies up to 2035, should be aligned with this more ambitious NDC.
- **Submit a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC** with a detailed plan to achieve the climate neutrality goal by 2050. This should again provide clarity on the intended role of the LULUCF sector in meeting Brazil’s long-term targets.
- **Develop a comprehensive energy transition policy** with a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and a detailed plan for achieving the transition in a just and equitable way. Brazil’s long-term energy plans see an expanded role for fossil gas and oil, with the production of both types of fossil fuel set to increase in the coming decade. This stands in stark contrast with both the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit and Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of COP30.
- **Maintain current hydropower generation alongside increasing wind and solar generation** to meet electricity demand growth and to replace the remaining fossil fuel generation, particularly fossil gas. With this, Brazil could put itself among the first countries in the world to reach the 100% clean electricity target by 2030.
- **Strengthen policies to mitigate emissions in the agriculture sector** as Brazil’s second-largest contributor to emissions, specifically looking at more sustainable and efficient agriculture methods to increase productivity of currently under-utilised land.
- **Continue to enforce laws to reduce deforestation**, especially in the Cerrado region prone to the expansion of the country’s main agricultural frontier, and where deforestation increased by 6% in 2023.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Brazil’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Brazil is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Brazil’s unconditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” and “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share, respectively. Brazil’s conditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To get a better rating Brazil needs to increase its climate target’s ambition and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

Our calculations show Brazil’s total emissions (excluding LULUCF) will reach between 1,162 MtCO2e and 1,180 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies. Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 or its 2030 targets. To peak and then rapidly decrease emissions, as required in order to limit warming to 1.5°C, Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors— including a reversal of present plans to expand fossil fuel energy sources.

The CAT rates Brazil’s policies and actions as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and actions need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Following the resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, the Inter-ministerial Council on Climate Change began reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035, a process that could take up to two years.

Recent studies reported deforestation rates falling in response to political action. A 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels was celebrated as an example of the effects of re-establishing law enforcement in the forestry sector. However, deforestation remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 compared to 2022.

Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues, signalling its commitment to shaping international climate policy. This is particularly relevant as 2025 will be the year when countries are mandated to submit updated and more ambitious 2035 climate targets under the Paris Agreement.

However, there are important and inconsistent elements in some of the new policy developments, which cast serious doubt on the government's commitment to ecological transformation and transition away from fossil fuels. In particular, Brazil’s new growth acceleration programme —Novo PAC— earmarks important parts of its budget for the production and development of oil and fossil gas industries; as well as the lack of concrete targets for a transition away from fossil fuels in the new Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE).

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

While the current NDC is stronger than that submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve Brazil's rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. Brazil reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this target still falls short of being a fair contribution to global climate action.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

Land use and forestry emissions have been by far the largest source of GHG emissions in Brazil since the early 1990s. Deforestation rates soared in 2019, with over one million hectares cleared in the legal Amazon, a 34% increase from 2018 and a staggering 120% surge from 2012, the historical low. Preventing and combating deforestation stands as the biggest challenge for the Lula administration.

The government has launched a new edition of the Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), with a target of zero deforestation by 2030 (also included in the NDC). Early results show a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022.

Meeting Brazil’s NDC target will require efforts to halt deforestation to be accompanied by extensive reforestation and restoration of native forests. This can help Brazil to transition towards scenarios where the land use sector not only reduces emissions but also actively removes carbon from the atmosphere.

Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated to date, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. Brazil has not yet submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor.**

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor.**

Brazil aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission (Government of Brazil, 2023b). However, no further details on the scope, architecture and transparency have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC.

Aiming for climate neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy, including LULUCF.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

Target covers emissions / sectors partially (under 95% coverage)

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Country makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Brazil aims to reach climate neutrality by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Brazil provides no information on the sectors and gases covered. Although the country consistently uses the term climate neutrality, which implies that the target covers all greenhouse gases, further information would enhance transparency of the net zero target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC. However, its current NDC makes reference to climate neutrality by 2050. The goal of climate neutrality by 2050 is stated in the Bill No. 6539, which was approved by the Senate in November 2021 and is going through the legislative process in the Chamber of Deputies.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Brazil has not provided information on whether it will establish separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Brazil does not provide an underlying emissions pathway to achieve the climate neutrality target, nor does it specify measures and actions needed to reach the goal.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

It has been difficult assessing Brazil's recently-submitted 2035 NDC target, largely due to the lack of published government data on the expected contribution of the land use sector (LULUCF) to the NDC target, resulting in an extraordinarily wide range of estimated emissions from all other sectors (excl. LULUCF) that are consistent with the NDC target. Ultimately, our analysis concludes that Brazil’s 2035 NDC target is not 1.5°C compatible.

Brazil submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 13 November 2024, setting a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions between 59–67% below 2005 levels in 2035. This target covers all sectors and all gases. According to the latest national inventory data for 2005, this is consistent with an emissions level between 832–1,033 MtCO2e in 2035 (in AR4 GWPs, incl. LULUCF).

Brazil has communicated its intent to use the Paris Agreement's Article 6, with carbon offset transfers being authorised to sell its emission reductions from 67% up to the level of 59% below 2005 levels by 2035. We therefore interpret Brazil’s target of 59% below 2005 by 2035 as the “national action component” of its target, or what it commits to do within its borders and with its own resources. The 67% below 2005 by 2035 would be the “internationally supported component” of its target, as the additional reduction beyond the 59% might generate financial resources through the international transfer of mitigation results.[1]

The Climate Action Tracker evaluates NDC targets excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in order to keep the focus on emissions from fossil fuels and industry, and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimations of LULUCF emissions and removals. Given the limited nature of the underlying data so far published by the Brazilian government on LULUCF emissions, we had to build our own range of what the LULUCF contribution to the 2035 NDC could be.

For this, we considered Brazil’s intention to achieve zero deforestation, by eliminating illegal deforestation and compensating for the legal suppression of native vegetation, as stated in its NDC. Under this assumption, we reviewed several studies under which the LULUCF sector would represent a sink in 2035. The size of the sink varied widely across studies, going from -120 MtCO2e/yr to -610 MtCO2e/yr[2]. However, we also observed substantial deviation in historical LULUCF data (2020) across studies, and in comparison with what has been reported by the government in its latest emissions inventory. We therefore applied an offset harmonisation approach to be able to compare these studies between them and to the official government data. After the harmonisation, the LULUCF range for 2035 expands further, now going from being a source of about 80 MtCO2e/yr to being a sink of -630 MtCO2e/yr.

The uncertainty around the LULUCF contribution to Brazil's 2035 NDC, driven by of a lack of published data from the government, results in an extraordinarily wide range of estimated emissions excluding LULUCF that are consistent with the NDC.

We welcome Brazil’s initiative to publish sectoral, detailed plans in the coming months and we hope these will include concrete targets and pathways we can use to update our assumptions. For now, the range based on our literature review leads to:

- The target of 59% below 2005, which we interpret as the national action component of the NDC, amounting to a range of between 1–76% above 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF (953–1,666 MtCO2e/yr).
- The target of 67% below 2005, which we interpret as the internationally supported component of the NDC, amounting to a range of 21% below to 55% above 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF (752–1,465 MtCO2e).
In both cases, the resulting level of 2035 emissions of the target (excl. LULUCF) is **not** aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. According to our most recent publication on what a 1.5°C aligned NDC should look like, to be 1.5°C compatible, Brazil would need to reduce its emissions excl. LULUCF in 2035 to at least 25% below 2005 levels (706 MtCO2e), which is about 36% below 2020 emission levels.

In the same way, when including LULUCF emissions, neither of the NDC’s two targets are aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. To be 1.5°C compatible, Brazil would need to reduce at least 85% of their total emissions (incl. LULUCF) by 2035, compared to 2005 levels (368 MtCO2e).

- The target of 59% below 2005 amounts to 1,033 MtCO2e in 2035, incl. LULUCF.
- The target of 67% below 2005 amounts to 832 MtCO2e in 2035, incl. LULUCF.
Brazil’s recent NDC submission did not increase the ambition of its 2030 mitigation target. A failure to substantially increase the ambition of its 2030 targets and action would mean Brazil's ability to limit peak global warming to 1.5°C will be more difficult. Deeper and more rapid emissions reduction targets will be required elsewhere, which will likely lead to a multi-decadal, high overshoot of this limit, even if followed by strong 2035 targets.

[1] According to our methodology, for the case of Brazil, we only compared the internationally supported component of the target to our modelled domestic pathways

[2] Studies considered included e.g., the “Clima e Desenvolvemento: Viöes para o Brazil 2030” report from Instituto Talanoa & Centro Clima; a paper from Soterroni, A., et al (2023) with Forest Code (FC) and Forest Code Plus (FC+) scenarios; the technical note “Bases para proposta de 2a NDC para o Brasil 2030-2035” from Observatorio de Clima & SEEG; amongst others.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. Brazil’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

* According to our methodology, for the case of Brazil we only compared the internationally supported component of the target to our modelled domestic pathways

The internationally supported component of Brazil’s submitted 2035 NDC, of a 67% reduction in emissions below 2005 levels, will result in 752–1,465 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2035, roughly 55% above to 21% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF) and is **not** aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways: the entire range is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold of **706 **MtCO2e, or a 25% reduction below 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF.

The CAT welcomes Brazil’s commitment to reduce emissions with its own resources but given the large uncertainty derived from the lack of information on the expected contribution of the LULUCF sector, it is difficult to evaluate the Brazilian government's commitment.

The 2035 NDC target includes a reference to its national process of updating the National Plan on Climate Change (Climate Plan), which includes a "National Mitigation Strategy" with seven sectoral mitigation plans. However, the NDC only provides a qualitative description of sectoral mitigation plans, with no targets nor pathways explicitly communicated.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Whether Brazil should receive climate finance to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows a small amount of international support is technically consistent with a wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. However, this contribution would likely be small under most equity perspectives. Brazil’s submitted 2035 conditional NDC is not 1.5°C compatible with modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the – still significant – emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

According to our latest assessment, Brazil’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF) will reach between 1,094 MtCO2e and 1,197 MtCO2e in 2035 under current policies and actions. The lower end of the domestic component of the 2035 target, to reduce 59% below 2005 levels, is aligned with the current policy projections but is not driving mitigation ambition. This highlights the fact that both Brazil’s targets and polices are lacking ambition to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

Brazil’s NDC includes a description of national planning and implementation processes, including mention of its existing relevant policies and the update of the National Plan on Climate Change (Climate Plan). However, while it states an intention to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by promoting biofuels and electrification solutions, the NDC fails to include a fixed timeline for phasing out fossil fuels.

There is also no attention given to the recent policies that continue to allocate significant resources to the production and development of oil and fossil gas in the next decade, which raises serious concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil and the credibility of its mitigation targets.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

Brazil’s NDC includes a target that covers all gases and sectors of the economy. However, the formulation of the target has reverted from an absolute emissions reduction to a percentage reduction compared to 2005. The target explicitly indicates that Brazil will adopt the latest National Inventory Report available at the time of assessing progress towards the NDC. Essentially, Brazil is reserving the right to revise its baseline emissions rather than concentrating efforts on reducing emissions in absolute terms.

At the sectoral level, the NDC lacks quantitative specificity and clear targets. In particular, it does not include any details on the expected contributions of LULUCF to the 2035 target. In Brazil's case, the share of expected LULUCF emissions (or removals) has huge implications for the level of decarbonisation required for other sectors of the economy. According to our guidelines for a good NDC, any contribution of the LULUCF sector, engineered and novel types of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets under Article 6, should be stated separately.

Brazil has communicated its intent to use Article 6, with transfers being authorised to sell the reductions from 59% up to the level of 67% below 2005 levels by 2035. This poses a major risk for Brazil’s long-term mitigation ambition: achieving further mitigation reductions in the future (as needed under the Paris Agreement) will become much more difficult, and more expensive.

# Policies & action

The CAT rates Brazil’s policies and action as “Insufficient”. Brazil’s emissions (excluding emissions from the forestry and land sector) have steadily increased over the past decades but are expected to essentially plateau under current policies, growing only slightly until 2030. Yet, Brazil needs to cut its emissions this decade to meet its 2030 target and for 1.5°C compatibility.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

## Policy overview

In October 2022, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected president of Brazil for the third time, defeating former president Jair Bolsonaro. He assumed the presidency in January 2023, quickly moving away from the previous administration’s policies and reconstructing the country’s environmental policy which had suffered from budget cuts and policy rollbacks (Nature, 2023). Some positive policy developments can already be highlighted, including:

- Following the resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, the Inter-ministerial Council on Climate Change began reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035, a process that could take up to two years (Talanoa, 2023).
- Recent studies reported deforestation rates falling in response to political action (BBC, 2024; Global Forest Watch, 2024). A 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels was celebrated as an example of the effects of re-establishing law enforcement in the forestry sector. However, deforestation remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 (BBC, 2024; Nature, 2023)
- Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues, signalling its commitment to shaping international climate policy. This is particularly relevant as 2025 will be the year when countries are mandated to submit updated and more ambitious 2035 climate targets under the Paris Agreement.
- The development of new policies such as the Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE) to promote sustainable development while reducing Brazil’s overall environmental footprint, and which includes energy transition as one of its six pillars of action (Government of Brazil, 2023d; Talanoa, 2023).
However, there are still important and inconsistent elements in the new policy development that raise concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil's infrastructure agenda, which cast serious doubt on the government's commitment to ecological transformation and transition away from fossil fuels (Nature, 2023), in particular:

- Brazil’s Novo PAC (a new USD 350bn growth acceleration programme designed to stimulate private and public investments in infrastructure, development and environmental projects) which assigned around USD 110bn (just over 30%) of its budget to “energy transition and security” while earmarking 63% of its budget for the oil and fossil gas industries, mainly for the production and development of these fossil fuels (Government of Brazil, 2023c, 2023e).
- The actions outlined under the energy transition pillar of the PTE focus mostly on reducing transport emissions by electrification or low-carbon fuels and further development of wind and solar energy; without concrete targets related to a transition away from fossil fuels.
- Brazil is yet to put forward a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and questions remain as to how it will achieve an energy transition in a just and equitable way (Nature, 2023).
Our calculations show Brazil’s total emissions (excluding LULUCF) will reach between 1,162 MtCO2e and 1,197 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies, almost 25% above 2005 levels. Brazil is not on track to reach neither its 2025 target nor its 2030. To peak and then rapidly decrease emissions, as required in order to limit warming to 1.5°C, Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors— including a reversal of present plans to expand fossil fuel energy sources.


## Power sector

Brazil’s share of renewables in the power sector represented almost 90% in 2022, while fossil gas and coal made up a share of about 10% of electricity generation (IEA, 2024a). Brazil’s high share of renewables is mainly due to the substantial contributions of hydroelectricity in the system, which makes it one of the world's cleanest power grids today. However, this also highlights Brazil’s vulnerability to climate change, at a time when the country faces both historic droughts that have led to low hydro power generation and a spike in fossil fuel use (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022; Talanoa, 2023).

The 2031 ten-year energy expansion plan (PDE 2031) highlights this vulnerability and gives special attention to uncertainties regarding future water availability and impacts on hydroelectric generation from existing and planned plants. In response, the PDE proposes the diversification of the matrix based on investments in renewable sources in addition to hydroelectric plants (i.e., wind, biomass and photovoltaic) complemented by fossil gas power plants.

In this scenario, the share of hydropower capacity in Brazil’s electricity system would steadily decrease from 83% in 2000, to 46% by 2031 (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022). Expanding fossil gas power generation is not in line with 1.5°C, which would require coal and gas to be phased out of Brazil's power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024). Increasing fossil gas capacity is thus in stark contrast with Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of its hosting of COP30.


### Coal

Brazil has not adopted COP26’s coal exit initiative which seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Although Brazil has an electricity mix with a high share of renewables, coal still represents 2-3% of Brazil’s electricity generation, though 2022 saw the lowest level in a decade (IEA, 2024a; Our World in Data, 2024).

Coal power in Brazil is highly reliant on government subsidies, which are set to expire in 2027 (Inesc, 2022). Brazil’s Ten-Year Energy Expansion Plan (PDE 2031) includes modelling studies that show that most coal capacity could exit the system in 2027 and 2028 as power contracts and subsidies expire (PNME, 2023). However, the same document also proposes the expansion of 350 MW/year of coal-fired power projects, between 2028 and 2031, through the modernisation of the existing plants or their replacement with more modern ones. This would bring back an overall 1.4 GW of coal capacity into Brazil’s energy mix by 2031 (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022). Once again, such developments are in stark contrast with what is needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C which, for Brazil, would mean reaching a full phase-out of coal in power generation by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

At COP28, Brazil joined the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency pledge which also highlights the need for a phase down of unabated coal power, in particular ending investment in unabated new coal-fired power plants (UNFCCC news, 2023). Brazil remains the second-largest user of coal for power generation in the region (IEA, 2024a).


### Share of coal in electricity generation


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2022, oil accounted for 1.5% of total electricity generation in Brazil. The share of oil for power has been steadily decreasing over the years from a high of 5.6% in 2014. Gas represented 6.2% in 2022, a small decrease from the average 10% over the last ten years (IEA, 2024a).

However, Brazil is currently planning on significantly expanding its fossil gas fleet. There are 41 GW of fossil gas and oil power plants, either announced or in pre-construction phase in Brazil, with over 4 GW currently under construction (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Expanding fossil-based generation risks Brazil losing out on its considerable potential for renewable power generation, and is not compatible with 1.5°C. As well as expanding fossil gas electricity generation, the government is planning on expanding oil and fossil gas production. For further details on the oil and gas production industry in Brazil, see the industry section below.


### Renewables

Renewables have consistently contributed to over 80% of Brazil's electricity production, with figures reaching up to 88% in 2022. The majority of this comes from large hydropower plants, with makes Brazil's electricity mix one of the cleanest in the world (IEA, 2024a). However, some of these dams have caused large social conflicts, as they have displaced indigenous peoples (WWF, 2024).

The deployment of wind and solar energy is accelerating, with their combined share in electricity production rising from 1% in 2012 to 16% in 2022 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). Renewables are highly competitive in Brazil, with recent auctions delivering contracts to renewable projects only, and wind and solar generation are set to grow rapidly under current policies and market conditions (IEA, 2024b).

Much of the capacity expansion planned in Brazil is wind and solar: Brazil’s Novo PAC aims to have 80% of the added electricity capacity coming from renewable sources. However, renewable deployment needs to be further accelerated and delivered alongside a fossil fuel phase-out. By maintaining current hydropower generation, and increasing wind and solar energy to meet electricity demand growth and displace the remaining fossil fuel generation, particularly fossil gas, Brazil could potentially reach the 100% clean electricity target by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation


## Industry and fuel supply

In 2022, industrial emissions accounted for nearly 10% of the nation's total emissions (excluding LULUCF) (Gütschow et al., 2024). Additionally, direct and indirect emissions from Brazil's industrial sector contribute 27.4% and 4.3% of energy-related CO2 emissions, respectively (Climate Transparency, 2022). While there is progress in the power sector, policies to curb emissions from sectors like steel, cement, and oil and fossil gas continue to be limited, and tend to focus mostly on promoting economic development.

Brazil’s new government uses the term "neo-industrialisation" to emphasise the urgency to lay new foundations for the sector's growth. However, policies such as the “New Brazil Industry” focus mostly on economic development rather than pushing for a green transition in the sector. Even though the new growth acceleration programme — called Novo PAC —claims to signal a shift towards green neo-industrialisation, the same programme also designates significant funds to the oil and gas industries (see below for more details).

**Oil and gas industries**

As outlined in multiple federal government planning documents, Brazil intends to expand its oil production until at least 2029 while fossil gas production is expected to maintain its high levels well into the next ten years (Talanoa, 2023). The 2050 National Energy Plan, a long-term planning instrument, projects an increase in demand for oil derivatives by that year. According to this plan, Brazil will remain a major producer of oil and fossil gas (Talanoa, 2023). At the same time, Brazil’s new growth acceleration programme (Novo PAC) has earmarked more than 60% of the investments for “energy transition and security” to oil and gas, specifically for the production and development of these fossil fuel industries (Nature, 2023).

Brazil was the world’s ninth-biggest oil producer in 2022 and the eighth-largest consumer of petroleum products. Brazil has policies in place that aim at making Brazil the world’s fourth-largest oil producer until the end of this decade (Nature, 2023). At COP28, Brazil’s energy minister decided to announce that Brazil plans to align itself more closely with OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries (Reuters, 2023).

According to the IEA’s latest net-zero roadmap, which outlines pathways to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, there is no room for any new oil, fossil gas, and coal exploration if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (IEA, 2023a). Therefore, Brazil’s oil and gas industry developments are in stark contrast with the 1.5°C temperature limit of the Paris Agreement and with Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of COP30.


## Transport

Transport makes up just over 50% of Brazil’s energy sector emissions, and emissions have been steadily increasing since 2018, mainly due to increased vehicle ownership (SEEG, 2023a).

As part of its energy transition goals, Brazil launched the Fuels of the Future Programme which plans to increase the ethanol blend in gasoline from 22% to 27%, as well as the amount of biodiesel blended into diesel from 14% to 20% by 2030. The programme also looks at reducing aviation emissions by gradually increasing the mix of sustainable fuels and stipulates that airlines must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1% in 2027 and by 10% in 2037 (Silva, 2024; Talanoa, 2023). Brazil is currently one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of biofuels. If the bill is approved by the Senate later this year, this programme would boost the ethanol industry in the country.

However, it's essential to ensure that biomass used in future energy systems is sustainably sourced. This means preventing upstream emissions from land-use changes, avoiding competition with food crops, protecting biodiversity, and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples in that land (Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). Furthermore, while biofuels may have reduced the emissions intensity of the road transport sector in Brazil, the potential for further reductions in emissions by biofuel blending is limited (ICCT, 2023). Instead, full decarbonisation of the transport sector will require fast uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). Brazil has not set a specific target for electric vehicles and has not joined the COP27’s Accelerating to Zero coalition (A2Z), which states that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets.

According to the third yearbook on electric mobility, the sale of EVs has grown significantly in recent years. According to the latest estimates, around 2.5% of light-duty vehicles sold in 2022 were electric. The number of EVs sold in 2023 almost doubled compared to the previous year, a positive development that surpassed all projections (Audi, 2024; PNME, 2023). However, despite these positive development, there is still a long way to go. For comparison, the 1.5°C compatible share of EV sales in Brazil would need to be above 45% by 2030 (see figure below). Increasing electrification of the transport sector would also reduce Brazil’s dependency on biofuels, particularly those produced from soy, thereby reducing pressure on Brazilian land for soy farming (PNME, 2023).


### EV market share


## Agriculture

Agriculture is the second biggest contributor to Brazil’s GHG emissions after the land use sector (LULUCF), with emissions consistently growing over the years and reaching its highest reported levels in 2022 at just over 600 MtCO2e. Excluding LULUCF emissions, agriculture and livestock represent just over half of the country’s emissions. Almost 75% of the sector’s emissions are methane and nitrous oxide from livestock alone (SEEG, 2023a). If the indirect emissions of the agriculture sector (mostly related to deforestation resulting from the expansion of agricultural land) were considered, the sector would be by far the single largest emissions source in Brazil.

However, there are limited policies in place to reduce agricultural emissions. Brazil’s main policy instrument of agricultural activity is the Agricultural Plan (Plano Safra) which aims to facilitate sustainable development by providing credit lines tailored to support crop production and product marketing (CPI, 2023). The Plano Safra for 2023/2024, with a record allocation of BRL 435bn for agricultural financing, designates only 0.5% of this sum for low-carbon measures in the sector (Talanoa, 2023). Furthermore, the new Safra Plan 24/25, unveiled in the first half of 2024, has a 16.5% increase in investment credit lines. This the largest increase in public resources the Safra Plan has received so far (Government of Brazil, 2024).

Renovagro, formerly known as ABC+ Plan, supports low-carbon agriculture by financing practices such as land restoration, integrated crop-livestock-forest systems, the production of bio-fertilisers, and others. The ABC+ Plan aims to prevent over one billion tonnes of carbon emissions between 2021-2030, primarily through restoring degraded pastures and planting forests.

The Brazilian agricultural sector is heavily dependent on fertilisers. In November 2023, the government approved the revised National Fertiliser Plan 2050 aiming to reduce the country’s dependence on fertiliser imports — currently at 87% of total demand — and meet 45% to 50% of the demand domestically by 2050. The plan outlines strategies such as reactivating idle factories, incentivising new industrial plants, and investing in sustainable nutrient production to achieve the goal.

Historically, there is a strong relationship between agriculture expansion and deforestation emissions in Brazil. Forest land is consistently lost to make room for agriculture and cattle ranching. The expansion of soybean plantations became a direct driver of deforestation as it became more financially attractive than cattle ranching (Ionova, 2021). Forests are either directly converted to soybean farms, or soybeans are planted on old pasture, driving deforestation for more pastureland (Kimbrough, 2021).

However, expanding the agriculture frontier through deforestation is unnecessary to increase productivity. Brazil has considerable potential to add value and productivity to already available but currently underutilised land by investing in more sustainable and efficient agriculture methods (Observatório do Clima, 2019; Stabile et al., 2020).


## Forestry

Inventory emissions data available shows that the land use and forestry sector has been by far the largest source of GHG emissions in Brazil since the early 1990s. The year 2019 saw an area of over one million hectares deforested in the legal Amazon — 34% larger than in 2018, and 120% larger than the historical low reached in 2012 (INPE, 2020). In 2021, emissions from land use changed reached a new high — 10% higher than those reported for 2019 (SEEG, 2023a). The high deforestation rates are linked to a weakening of Brazil’s institutional and legal frameworks for environmental protection carried out by the previous administration. Weak land tenure enabled land grabbers to occupy and, in many cases, deforest undesignated public forests.

Preventing and combating deforestation stands as the biggest challenge for Brazil’s new administration. In this context, the Lula government launched a new edition of the Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) in June 2023, with a target to reach zero deforestation by 2030. With deforestation in the region projected to decrease by 75% to 80% by 2027 under this plan, Brazil aims to reverse the alarming trends observed, including the loss of 27,800 km2 of forest in 2021, marking the second-highest rate in history (Government of Brazil, 2023a; Talanoa, 2023).

This change in policy focus in Brazil's government is already yielding results. Recent studies reported a 36% drop in primary forest loss in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022. However, deforestation still remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado region where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 (BBC, 2024; Nature, 2023). The new PPCDAm includes a goal to reach zero deforestation by 2030 in the Cerrado, the region where the country’s agricultural land is expanding and the source of numerous major river basins, vital to the nation's water resources. In 2021, Brazil signed the COP26’s forestry pledge “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

Meeting Brazil’s NDC target will require that efforts to halt deforestation are accompanied by extensive reforestation and restoration of native forests. This can help Brazil to transition towards scenarios where the land use sector not only reduces emissions but also actively removes carbon from the atmosphere (Government of Brazil, 2023a; Talanoa, 2023).


## Methane

Brazil signed the methane pledge at COP26. At the time of joining the pledge, Brazil stood as the world's sixth-largest emitter of methane. Close to 30% of Brazil’s total GHG emissions incl. LULUCF are from methane, with more than 75% coming from agricultural activities, followed by energy and waste.

In March 2022, the federal government launched the ‘zero methane’ programme. However, it focuses primarily on actions to reduce emissions in the waste sector and to use methane for energy use, such as biogas and biomethane. In some sectors, such as meat production, this initiative was not well received. The Ministry of Agriculture stated that this measure would affect the economic growth of the sector. To date, Brazil lacks a public policy roadmap to guide its efforts in achieving the necessary methane reduction to fulfil its international commitment.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2020 are taken from Brazil’s annual estimated GHG emissions inventory (Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacaoes, 2022). We estimated emissions for 2021 and 2022 using the sectoral growth rates for each sector as reported by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals Estimation System (SEEG) initiative (SEEG, 2023b).

LULUCF emissions from 1990 to 2020 are taken directly from Brazil’s annual estimated GHG emissions inventory (Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacaoes, 2022).


## NDC

The CAT rating of Brazil’s NDC is based on its 2030 target as communicated in their NDC submitted in October 2023 (Government of Brazil, 2023b). Brazil’s 2030 NDC target covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6).

Brazil’s NDC provides an absolute emissions level for 2025 and 2030, including LULUCF, and is reported using AR5 GWP values. The CAT converted the emissions level for both 2025 and 2030 to AR4 GWP using a gas-by-gas and sector-by-sector approach to recalculate emissions from 2005 (baseline year) in AR4. This results in emissions levels of 1.30 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1.18 GtCO2e in 2030.

The CAT then proceeds to estimate and exclude emissions from the LULUCF sector. For this, we take LULUCF emissions for 2025 and 2030 as reported in the government’s report titled “Mitigation trajectories and public policy instruments to achieve Brazil's goals under the Paris Agreement” (Ministério da Ciência Tecnologia Inovações e Comunicações Brasil, 2017). The LULUCF emissions levels in 2025 and 2030 are 321 MtCO2e and 298 MtCO2e, respectively. These national projections for LULUCF do not include the current fluctuations in deforestation rates; if emissions from deforestation would rise again, Brazil would need to further reduce emissions in other sectors in order to meet their NDC target.

Our NDC estimates are highly dependent on the assumptions of the LULUCF contribution to overall emissions which, based on historical trends, can vary significantly. We use projections as reported by the government in 2017 for consistency and to allow for comparison between target updates in recent years. We expect additional clarity from Brazil on the role of LULUCF emissions in its targets for its next communication.


## Net zero target

Brazil has committed to being climate neutral by 2050. However, given the lack of additional details communicated so far, we were unable to provide an accurate estimate of what Brazil’s 2050 target means for the country’s emissions. Further clarity on sectoral contributions, assumptions on the role LULUCF would play in achieving the target and potential use of international carbon credits would be helpful to assess the comprehensiveness of the target.

We include Brazil in our ‘Optimistic scenario’ as part of our 2100 temperature warming estimate. We include a “CAT estimate” of Brazil’s climate neutrality target, which represents our assessment of what the target could represent. We assume that Brazil will achieve net zero by 2070 (excluding emissions from LULUCF) with a linear progression from the country’s last target (the 2030 NDC in 2030) to zero in 2070. This scenario translates into Brazil needing a sink of roughly 440 MtCO2e in 2050 to reach its carbon neutrality goal.


## Current policy projections

For the current policies scenario, we present a range which is calculated as described below.

Higher end of the range:

- Energy and Industry sector CO2 emissions are taken from the latest projections from the World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2023b).
- Energy, Industry, Agriculture and Waste sector non-CO2 emissions are taken from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 to 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).
- Other CO2 emissions from the agriculture sector are calculated based on the historical trend of the sector’s CO2 emissions (2013-2022).
- Other CO2 emissions for the waste sector are calculated by taking the average level of the last four years at 2022 levels.
- All of the above were harmonised to the last historical data point.
Lower end of the range:

Total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF taken from the 2023 Global Energy and Climate Outlook (JRC, 2023) and harmonised to the last historical data point.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

On 27 October 2023, the Brazilian government reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets it submitted when it joined the Paris Agreement in 2016, moving away from the NDC updates communicated by the Bolsonaro administration.

In this 2023 NDC, Brazil sets an unconditional target to limit emissions to 1.32 GtCO2e in 2025 and to 1.2 GtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using AR5 GWP values. The CAT excludes emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and converts it to AR4 GWP (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2025 target of up to 979 MtCO2e and a 2030 target of up to 884 MtCO2e. The CAT rates Brazil’s 2030 target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to both Brazil’s fair share and modelled domestic pathways.

In its NDC, Brazil includes a goal to reach climate neutrality by 2050 but they it not submitted an LTS or communicated further details on the target. In particular, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions in all sectors, including LULUCF.

## NDC Updates

In October 2023, Brazil resubmitted the emissions limits for 2025 and 2030 originally included in its first NDC of 2016. The government did not increase its mitigation ambition with this new submission, nor did it respond to the COP26 mandate to revisit and strengthen its 2030 targets.

In its 2023 submission, Brazil reconfirmed the 1.32 GtCO2e and 1.2 GtCO2e emission limits for 2025 and 2030, respectively. It noted that these limits are consistent with emission reductions of 48.4% and 53.1%, below 2005 levels based on the latest inventory data. While the emission limits are the same in the two submissions, we consider the nature of Brazil’s target formulation to have improved, given it now emphasises the emission limits, rather than percentage reduction targets.

Brazil is one of the few countries that has both a 2025 and 2030 target and has indicated that its next target will also be on a five-year scale to 2035. According to its NDC, Brazil will strive to meet its targets through domestic measures, but has not ruled out the use of international carbon markets. Brazil’s targets are not conditional on international support, though cooperation is welcome.

According to our calculations, Brazil will need to implement additional policies and actions to be able to reduce emissions and achieve its NDC targets.

* The difference in the CAT quantification of the original and 2023 NDC emissions limits is due to our conversion into AR4 values and the method use (see the Assumptions tab for details). The limits put forward by Brazil are the same.** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("modelled domestic pathways"). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with its share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Brazil has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both its fair share contribution and the level of reductions needed in line with modelled domestic pathways.

The CAT assesses emissions excluding LULUCF. Our estimates of Brazil’s targets excluding LULUCF — and their corresponding rating — are highly dependent on the assumptions on the extent to which Brazil will rely on the sector to achieve its NDC. Brazil’s NDC mentions their commitment to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 but it does not give further details as to the expected emissions level for the sector in the future. We expect additional clarity from Brazil in its next communication.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

While the current NDC is stronger than the one submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve its rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and needs to adopt additional policies to cut its emissions.

Whether Brazil should receive climate finance from abroad to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows Brazil needing a small amount of international support is technically consistent with a wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. However, this contribution would likely be small under most equity perspectives. As a result, the NDC target achieved with its own resources would still need to be improved to align more closely with the 1.5°C limit, regardless of international support.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. In 2023, Lula’s administration reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this new submission still falls short of being a fair contribution by Brazil to global climate action.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Brazil’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

## Net zero target

Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC.

Aiming for climate neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy, including LULUCF.

The full net zero target analysis can be found here.


# Summary


## Overview

**President Lula da Silva, inaugurated in January 2023, has prioritised the reconstruction of Brazil's environmental policy, emphasising low-carbon, socio-economic development. Brazil's forthcoming presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 also shows the country’s strengthened cooperation and re-engagement with the international community. In October 2023, Brazil** **reverted to its original** **NDC targets****, reflecting a renewed focus on combating deforestation. Initial reports indicate a 36% decrease in primary forest loss in 2023 compared to 2022 due to strengthened law enforcement.**

Domestically, Brazil has adopted new economy-wide policies to support sustainable development and job creation which highlights the government’s commitment to invest in infrastructure, industry and the transformation of the economy. While these policies include energy transition as one of their main pillars of action, Brazil is yet to have a fixed timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and will continue to allocate significant resources to the production and development of oil and fossil gas in the next decade, which raises concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil's infrastructure agenda. Expanding oil and fossil gas production contradicts the Paris Agreement's target and Brazil’s ambition to lead on climate action ahead of COP30. With this update, Brazil’s overall rating of its climate targets and actions remain rated “Insufficient”.

Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 target or its 2030. Brazil’s emissions under current policies (excluding the land use and land use change — or LULUCF — sector) have essentially plateaued, expected to only slightly grow over the rest of the decade. Yet, Brazil needs to peak and rapidly decrease emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C. Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors, including a reversal of present plans to expand the exploitation of fossil fuel energy sources.

Recent positive policy developments include:

- **The change in government** which is prioritising reconstructing the country’s environmental policy which had suffered from budget cuts and policy rollbacks in the past.
- **The resubmission of its NDC in October 2023,** followed by the ongoing process of reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035.
- **Deforestation rates falling** in response to political action as recent studies indicate a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels.
- **Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025** highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues.
- **The development of new policies** such as the Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE) to promote sustainable development while reducing Brazil’s overall environmental footprint, and which includes energy transition as one of its six pillars of action.
To improve its climate targets and action rating, Brazil could:

- **Submit a new and significantly more ambitious NDC** which clearly outlines the different sectors' contributions to the mitigation target, in particular that of the LULUCF sector. The National Climate Change Policy, currently under development and which will include sectoral mitigation strategies up to 2035, should be aligned with this more ambitious NDC.
- **Submit a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC** with a detailed plan to achieve the climate neutrality goal by 2050. This should again provide clarity on the intended role of the LULUCF sector in meeting Brazil’s long-term targets.
- **Develop a comprehensive energy transition policy** with a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and a detailed plan for achieving the transition in a just and equitable way. Brazil’s long-term energy plans see an expanded role for fossil gas and oil, with the production of both types of fossil fuel set to increase in the coming decade. This stands in stark contrast with both the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit and Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of COP30.
- **Maintain current hydropower generation alongside increasing wind and solar generation** to meet electricity demand growth and to replace the remaining fossil fuel generation, particularly fossil gas. With this, Brazil could put itself among the first countries in the world to reach the 100% clean electricity target by 2030.
- **Strengthen policies to mitigate emissions in the agriculture sector** as Brazil’s second-largest contributor to emissions, specifically looking at more sustainable and efficient agriculture methods to increase productivity of currently under-utilised land.
- **Continue to enforce laws to reduce deforestation**, especially in the Cerrado region prone to the expansion of the country’s main agricultural frontier, and where deforestation increased by 6% in 2023.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates Brazil’s climate targets and policies as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Brazil is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Brazil’s unconditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” and “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share, respectively. Brazil’s conditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To get a better rating Brazil needs to increase its climate target’s ambition and establish associated policies that can curb the growth in national emissions and set them on a downward trend.

Our calculations show Brazil’s total emissions (excluding LULUCF) will reach between 1,162 MtCO2e and 1,180 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies. Brazil is not on track to reach either its 2025 or its 2030 targets. To peak and then rapidly decrease emissions, as required in order to limit warming to 1.5°C, Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors— including a reversal of present plans to expand fossil fuel energy sources.

The CAT rates Brazil’s policies and actions as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and actions need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

Following the resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, the Inter-ministerial Council on Climate Change began reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035, a process that could take up to two years.

Recent studies reported deforestation rates falling in response to political action. A 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels was celebrated as an example of the effects of re-establishing law enforcement in the forestry sector. However, deforestation remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 compared to 2022.

Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues, signalling its commitment to shaping international climate policy. This is particularly relevant as 2025 will be the year when countries are mandated to submit updated and more ambitious 2035 climate targets under the Paris Agreement.

However, there are important and inconsistent elements in some of the new policy developments, which cast serious doubt on the government's commitment to ecological transformation and transition away from fossil fuels. In particular, Brazil’s new growth acceleration programme —Novo PAC— earmarks important parts of its budget for the production and development of oil and fossil gas industries; as well as the lack of concrete targets for a transition away from fossil fuels in the new Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE).

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

While the current NDC is stronger than that submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve Brazil's rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. Brazil reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this target still falls short of being a fair contribution to global climate action.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

Land use and forestry emissions have been by far the largest source of GHG emissions in Brazil since the early 1990s. Deforestation rates soared in 2019, with over one million hectares cleared in the legal Amazon, a 34% increase from 2018 and a staggering 120% surge from 2012, the historical low. Preventing and combating deforestation stands as the biggest challenge for the Lula administration.

The government has launched a new edition of the Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), with a target of zero deforestation by 2030 (also included in the NDC). Early results show a 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022.

Meeting Brazil’s NDC target will require efforts to halt deforestation to be accompanied by extensive reforestation and restoration of native forests. This can help Brazil to transition towards scenarios where the land use sector not only reduces emissions but also actively removes carbon from the atmosphere.

Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated to date, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. Brazil has not yet submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC. We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor.**

# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate Brail’s net zero target as: **Poor.**

Brazil aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission (Government of Brazil, 2023b). However, no further details on the scope, architecture and transparency have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC.

Aiming for climate neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy, including LULUCF.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

Target covers emissions / sectors partially (under 95% coverage)

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target announced

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Country provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

There is no information or underlying analysis available on the anticipated pathway or measures to achieve net zero emissions

Country makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Brazil aims to reach climate neutrality by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – Brazil provides no information on the sectors and gases covered. Although the country consistently uses the term climate neutrality, which implies that the target covers all greenhouse gases, further information would enhance transparency of the net zero target.
- **International aviation and shipping** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted an LTS to the UNFCCC. However, its current NDC makes reference to climate neutrality by 2050. The goal of climate neutrality by 2050 is stated in the Bill No. 6539, which was approved by the Senate in November 2021 and is going through the legislative process in the Chamber of Deputies.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Brazil has not provided information on whether it will establish separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to establish a review cycle for its net zero and intermediate targets.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals.
- **Comprehensive planning** – Brazil does not provide an underlying emissions pathway to achieve the climate neutrality target, nor does it specify measures and actions needed to reach the goal.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Brazil provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

It has been difficult assessing Brazil's recently-submitted 2035 NDC target, largely due to the lack of published government data on the expected contribution of the land use sector (LULUCF) to the NDC target, resulting in an extraordinarily wide range of estimated emissions from all other sectors (excl. LULUCF) that are consistent with the NDC target. Ultimately, our analysis concludes that Brazil’s 2035 NDC target is not 1.5°C compatible.

Brazil submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 13 November 2024, setting a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions between 59–67% below 2005 levels in 2035. This target covers all sectors and all gases. According to the latest national inventory data for 2005, this is consistent with an emissions level between 832–1,033 MtCO2e in 2035 (in AR4 GWPs, incl. LULUCF).

Brazil has communicated its intent to use the Paris Agreement's Article 6, with carbon offset transfers being authorised to sell its emission reductions from 67% up to the level of 59% below 2005 levels by 2035. We therefore interpret Brazil’s target of 59% below 2005 by 2035 as the “national action component” of its target, or what it commits to do within its borders and with its own resources. The 67% below 2005 by 2035 would be the “internationally supported component” of its target, as the additional reduction beyond the 59% might generate financial resources through the international transfer of mitigation results.[1]

The Climate Action Tracker evaluates NDC targets excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) in order to keep the focus on emissions from fossil fuels and industry, and because of the often-massive uncertainty in estimations of LULUCF emissions and removals. Given the limited nature of the underlying data so far published by the Brazilian government on LULUCF emissions, we had to build our own range of what the LULUCF contribution to the 2035 NDC could be.

For this, we considered Brazil’s intention to achieve zero deforestation, by eliminating illegal deforestation and compensating for the legal suppression of native vegetation, as stated in its NDC. Under this assumption, we reviewed several studies under which the LULUCF sector would represent a sink in 2035. The size of the sink varied widely across studies, going from -120 MtCO2e/yr to -610 MtCO2e/yr[2]. However, we also observed substantial deviation in historical LULUCF data (2020) across studies, and in comparison with what has been reported by the government in its latest emissions inventory. We therefore applied an offset harmonisation approach to be able to compare these studies between them and to the official government data. After the harmonisation, the LULUCF range for 2035 expands further, now going from being a source of about 80 MtCO2e/yr to being a sink of -630 MtCO2e/yr.

The uncertainty around the LULUCF contribution to Brazil's 2035 NDC, driven by of a lack of published data from the government, results in an extraordinarily wide range of estimated emissions excluding LULUCF that are consistent with the NDC.

We welcome Brazil’s initiative to publish sectoral, detailed plans in the coming months and we hope these will include concrete targets and pathways we can use to update our assumptions. For now, the range based on our literature review leads to:

- The target of 59% below 2005, which we interpret as the national action component of the NDC, amounting to a range of between 1–76% above 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF (953–1,666 MtCO2e/yr).
- The target of 67% below 2005, which we interpret as the internationally supported component of the NDC, amounting to a range of 21% below to 55% above 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF (752–1,465 MtCO2e).
In both cases, the resulting level of 2035 emissions of the target (excl. LULUCF) is **not** aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. According to our most recent publication on what a 1.5°C aligned NDC should look like, to be 1.5°C compatible, Brazil would need to reduce its emissions excl. LULUCF in 2035 to at least 25% below 2005 levels (706 MtCO2e), which is about 36% below 2020 emission levels.

In the same way, when including LULUCF emissions, neither of the NDC’s two targets are aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways. To be 1.5°C compatible, Brazil would need to reduce at least 85% of their total emissions (incl. LULUCF) by 2035, compared to 2005 levels (368 MtCO2e).

- The target of 59% below 2005 amounts to 1,033 MtCO2e in 2035, incl. LULUCF.
- The target of 67% below 2005 amounts to 832 MtCO2e in 2035, incl. LULUCF.
Brazil’s recent NDC submission did not increase the ambition of its 2030 mitigation target. A failure to substantially increase the ambition of its 2030 targets and action would mean Brazil's ability to limit peak global warming to 1.5°C will be more difficult. Deeper and more rapid emissions reduction targets will be required elsewhere, which will likely lead to a multi-decadal, high overshoot of this limit, even if followed by strong 2035 targets.

[1] According to our methodology, for the case of Brazil, we only compared the internationally supported component of the target to our modelled domestic pathways

[2] Studies considered included e.g., the “Clima e Desenvolvemento: Viöes para o Brazil 2030” report from Instituto Talanoa & Centro Clima; a paper from Soterroni, A., et al (2023) with Forest Code (FC) and Forest Code Plus (FC+) scenarios; the technical note “Bases para proposta de 2a NDC para o Brasil 2030-2035” from Observatorio de Clima & SEEG; amongst others.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. Brazil’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

* According to our methodology, for the case of Brazil we only compared the internationally supported component of the target to our modelled domestic pathways

The internationally supported component of Brazil’s submitted 2035 NDC, of a 67% reduction in emissions below 2005 levels, will result in 752–1,465 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2035, roughly 55% above to 21% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF) and is **not** aligned with our 1.5°C compatible modelled domestic pathways: the entire range is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold of **706 **MtCO2e, or a 25% reduction below 2005 levels, excluding LULUCF.

The CAT welcomes Brazil’s commitment to reduce emissions with its own resources but given the large uncertainty derived from the lack of information on the expected contribution of the LULUCF sector, it is difficult to evaluate the Brazilian government's commitment.

The 2035 NDC target includes a reference to its national process of updating the National Plan on Climate Change (Climate Plan), which includes a "National Mitigation Strategy" with seven sectoral mitigation plans. However, the NDC only provides a qualitative description of sectoral mitigation plans, with no targets nor pathways explicitly communicated.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Whether Brazil should receive climate finance to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows a small amount of international support is technically consistent with a wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. However, this contribution would likely be small under most equity perspectives. Brazil’s submitted 2035 conditional NDC is not 1.5°C compatible with modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the – still significant – emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

According to our latest assessment, Brazil’s total emissions (excl. LULUCF) will reach between 1,094 MtCO2e and 1,197 MtCO2e in 2035 under current policies and actions. The lower end of the domestic component of the 2035 target, to reduce 59% below 2005 levels, is aligned with the current policy projections but is not driving mitigation ambition. This highlights the fact that both Brazil’s targets and polices are lacking ambition to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

Brazil’s NDC includes a description of national planning and implementation processes, including mention of its existing relevant policies and the update of the National Plan on Climate Change (Climate Plan). However, while it states an intention to reduce reliance on fossil fuels by promoting biofuels and electrification solutions, the NDC fails to include a fixed timeline for phasing out fossil fuels.

There is also no attention given to the recent policies that continue to allocate significant resources to the production and development of oil and fossil gas in the next decade, which raises serious concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil and the credibility of its mitigation targets.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

Brazil’s NDC includes a target that covers all gases and sectors of the economy. However, the formulation of the target has reverted from an absolute emissions reduction to a percentage reduction compared to 2005. The target explicitly indicates that Brazil will adopt the latest National Inventory Report available at the time of assessing progress towards the NDC. Essentially, Brazil is reserving the right to revise its baseline emissions rather than concentrating efforts on reducing emissions in absolute terms.

At the sectoral level, the NDC lacks quantitative specificity and clear targets. In particular, it does not include any details on the expected contributions of LULUCF to the 2035 target. In Brazil's case, the share of expected LULUCF emissions (or removals) has huge implications for the level of decarbonisation required for other sectors of the economy. According to our guidelines for a good NDC, any contribution of the LULUCF sector, engineered and novel types of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets under Article 6, should be stated separately.

Brazil has communicated its intent to use Article 6, with transfers being authorised to sell the reductions from 59% up to the level of 67% below 2005 levels by 2035. This poses a major risk for Brazil’s long-term mitigation ambition: achieving further mitigation reductions in the future (as needed under the Paris Agreement) will become much more difficult, and more expensive.

# Policies & action

The CAT rates Brazil’s policies and action as “Insufficient”. Brazil’s emissions (excluding emissions from the forestry and land sector) have steadily increased over the past decades but are expected to essentially plateau under current policies, growing only slightly until 2030. Yet, Brazil needs to cut its emissions this decade to meet its 2030 target and for 1.5°C compatibility.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

## Policy overview

In October 2022, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected president of Brazil for the third time, defeating former president Jair Bolsonaro. He assumed the presidency in January 2023, quickly moving away from the previous administration’s policies and reconstructing the country’s environmental policy which had suffered from budget cuts and policy rollbacks (Nature, 2023). Some positive policy developments can already be highlighted, including:

- Following the resubmission of its NDC in October 2023, the Inter-ministerial Council on Climate Change began reviewing the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC), which will now include sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies covering the period up to 2035 as well as indicative sectoral targets for 2030 and 2035, a process that could take up to two years (Talanoa, 2023).
- Recent studies reported deforestation rates falling in response to political action (BBC, 2024; Global Forest Watch, 2024). A 36% drop in primary forest losses in Brazil in 2023 compared to 2022 levels was celebrated as an example of the effects of re-establishing law enforcement in the forestry sector. However, deforestation remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 (BBC, 2024; Nature, 2023)
- Brazil's presidency of the G20 summit in 2024 and hosting of COP30 in 2025 highlight its renewed engagement with the international community on environmental issues, signalling its commitment to shaping international climate policy. This is particularly relevant as 2025 will be the year when countries are mandated to submit updated and more ambitious 2035 climate targets under the Paris Agreement.
- The development of new policies such as the Ecological Transformation Plan (PTE) to promote sustainable development while reducing Brazil’s overall environmental footprint, and which includes energy transition as one of its six pillars of action (Government of Brazil, 2023d; Talanoa, 2023).
However, there are still important and inconsistent elements in the new policy development that raise concerns about the prioritisation of sustainability and environmental goals within Brazil's infrastructure agenda, which cast serious doubt on the government's commitment to ecological transformation and transition away from fossil fuels (Nature, 2023), in particular:

- Brazil’s Novo PAC (a new USD 350bn growth acceleration programme designed to stimulate private and public investments in infrastructure, development and environmental projects) which assigned around USD 110bn (just over 30%) of its budget to “energy transition and security” while earmarking 63% of its budget for the oil and fossil gas industries, mainly for the production and development of these fossil fuels (Government of Brazil, 2023c, 2023e).
- The actions outlined under the energy transition pillar of the PTE focus mostly on reducing transport emissions by electrification or low-carbon fuels and further development of wind and solar energy; without concrete targets related to a transition away from fossil fuels.
- Brazil is yet to put forward a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels and questions remain as to how it will achieve an energy transition in a just and equitable way (Nature, 2023).
Our calculations show Brazil’s total emissions (excluding LULUCF) will reach between 1,162 MtCO2e and 1,197 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies, almost 25% above 2005 levels. Brazil is not on track to reach neither its 2025 target nor its 2030. To peak and then rapidly decrease emissions, as required in order to limit warming to 1.5°C, Brazil will need to sustain and strengthen policy implementation and accelerate mitigation action in all sectors— including a reversal of present plans to expand fossil fuel energy sources.


## Power sector

Brazil’s share of renewables in the power sector represented almost 90% in 2022, while fossil gas and coal made up a share of about 10% of electricity generation (IEA, 2024a). Brazil’s high share of renewables is mainly due to the substantial contributions of hydroelectricity in the system, which makes it one of the world's cleanest power grids today. However, this also highlights Brazil’s vulnerability to climate change, at a time when the country faces both historic droughts that have led to low hydro power generation and a spike in fossil fuel use (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022; Talanoa, 2023).

The 2031 ten-year energy expansion plan (PDE 2031) highlights this vulnerability and gives special attention to uncertainties regarding future water availability and impacts on hydroelectric generation from existing and planned plants. In response, the PDE proposes the diversification of the matrix based on investments in renewable sources in addition to hydroelectric plants (i.e., wind, biomass and photovoltaic) complemented by fossil gas power plants.

In this scenario, the share of hydropower capacity in Brazil’s electricity system would steadily decrease from 83% in 2000, to 46% by 2031 (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022). Expanding fossil gas power generation is not in line with 1.5°C, which would require coal and gas to be phased out of Brazil's power sector by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024). Increasing fossil gas capacity is thus in stark contrast with Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of its hosting of COP30.


### Coal

Brazil has not adopted COP26’s coal exit initiative which seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Although Brazil has an electricity mix with a high share of renewables, coal still represents 2-3% of Brazil’s electricity generation, though 2022 saw the lowest level in a decade (IEA, 2024a; Our World in Data, 2024).

Coal power in Brazil is highly reliant on government subsidies, which are set to expire in 2027 (Inesc, 2022). Brazil’s Ten-Year Energy Expansion Plan (PDE 2031) includes modelling studies that show that most coal capacity could exit the system in 2027 and 2028 as power contracts and subsidies expire (PNME, 2023). However, the same document also proposes the expansion of 350 MW/year of coal-fired power projects, between 2028 and 2031, through the modernisation of the existing plants or their replacement with more modern ones. This would bring back an overall 1.4 GW of coal capacity into Brazil’s energy mix by 2031 (Ministry of Mines and Energy, 2022). Once again, such developments are in stark contrast with what is needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C which, for Brazil, would mean reaching a full phase-out of coal in power generation by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

At COP28, Brazil joined the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency pledge which also highlights the need for a phase down of unabated coal power, in particular ending investment in unabated new coal-fired power plants (UNFCCC news, 2023). Brazil remains the second-largest user of coal for power generation in the region (IEA, 2024a).


### Share of coal in electricity generation


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2022, oil accounted for 1.5% of total electricity generation in Brazil. The share of oil for power has been steadily decreasing over the years from a high of 5.6% in 2014. Gas represented 6.2% in 2022, a small decrease from the average 10% over the last ten years (IEA, 2024a).

However, Brazil is currently planning on significantly expanding its fossil gas fleet. There are 41 GW of fossil gas and oil power plants, either announced or in pre-construction phase in Brazil, with over 4 GW currently under construction (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Expanding fossil-based generation risks Brazil losing out on its considerable potential for renewable power generation, and is not compatible with 1.5°C. As well as expanding fossil gas electricity generation, the government is planning on expanding oil and fossil gas production. For further details on the oil and gas production industry in Brazil, see the industry section below.


### Renewables

Renewables have consistently contributed to over 80% of Brazil's electricity production, with figures reaching up to 88% in 2022. The majority of this comes from large hydropower plants, with makes Brazil's electricity mix one of the cleanest in the world (IEA, 2024a). However, some of these dams have caused large social conflicts, as they have displaced indigenous peoples (WWF, 2024).

The deployment of wind and solar energy is accelerating, with their combined share in electricity production rising from 1% in 2012 to 16% in 2022 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). Renewables are highly competitive in Brazil, with recent auctions delivering contracts to renewable projects only, and wind and solar generation are set to grow rapidly under current policies and market conditions (IEA, 2024b).

Much of the capacity expansion planned in Brazil is wind and solar: Brazil’s Novo PAC aims to have 80% of the added electricity capacity coming from renewable sources. However, renewable deployment needs to be further accelerated and delivered alongside a fossil fuel phase-out. By maintaining current hydropower generation, and increasing wind and solar energy to meet electricity demand growth and displace the remaining fossil fuel generation, particularly fossil gas, Brazil could potentially reach the 100% clean electricity target by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).


### Share of renewables in electricity generation


## Industry and fuel supply

In 2022, industrial emissions accounted for nearly 10% of the nation's total emissions (excluding LULUCF) (Gütschow et al., 2024). Additionally, direct and indirect emissions from Brazil's industrial sector contribute 27.4% and 4.3% of energy-related CO2 emissions, respectively (Climate Transparency, 2022). While there is progress in the power sector, policies to curb emissions from sectors like steel, cement, and oil and fossil gas continue to be limited, and tend to focus mostly on promoting economic development.

Brazil’s new government uses the term "neo-industrialisation" to emphasise the urgency to lay new foundations for the sector's growth. However, policies such as the “New Brazil Industry” focus mostly on economic development rather than pushing for a green transition in the sector. Even though the new growth acceleration programme — called Novo PAC —claims to signal a shift towards green neo-industrialisation, the same programme also designates significant funds to the oil and gas industries (see below for more details).

**Oil and gas industries**

As outlined in multiple federal government planning documents, Brazil intends to expand its oil production until at least 2029 while fossil gas production is expected to maintain its high levels well into the next ten years (Talanoa, 2023). The 2050 National Energy Plan, a long-term planning instrument, projects an increase in demand for oil derivatives by that year. According to this plan, Brazil will remain a major producer of oil and fossil gas (Talanoa, 2023). At the same time, Brazil’s new growth acceleration programme (Novo PAC) has earmarked more than 60% of the investments for “energy transition and security” to oil and gas, specifically for the production and development of these fossil fuel industries (Nature, 2023).

Brazil was the world’s ninth-biggest oil producer in 2022 and the eighth-largest consumer of petroleum products. Brazil has policies in place that aim at making Brazil the world’s fourth-largest oil producer until the end of this decade (Nature, 2023). At COP28, Brazil’s energy minister decided to announce that Brazil plans to align itself more closely with OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries (Reuters, 2023).

According to the IEA’s latest net-zero roadmap, which outlines pathways to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, there is no room for any new oil, fossil gas, and coal exploration if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (IEA, 2023a). Therefore, Brazil’s oil and gas industry developments are in stark contrast with the 1.5°C temperature limit of the Paris Agreement and with Brazil’s aspiration to position itself as a climate leader ahead of COP30.


## Transport

Transport makes up just over 50% of Brazil’s energy sector emissions, and emissions have been steadily increasing since 2018, mainly due to increased vehicle ownership (SEEG, 2023a).

As part of its energy transition goals, Brazil launched the Fuels of the Future Programme which plans to increase the ethanol blend in gasoline from 22% to 27%, as well as the amount of biodiesel blended into diesel from 14% to 20% by 2030. The programme also looks at reducing aviation emissions by gradually increasing the mix of sustainable fuels and stipulates that airlines must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1% in 2027 and by 10% in 2037 (Silva, 2024; Talanoa, 2023). Brazil is currently one of the world’s largest producers and consumers of biofuels. If the bill is approved by the Senate later this year, this programme would boost the ethanol industry in the country.

However, it's essential to ensure that biomass used in future energy systems is sustainably sourced. This means preventing upstream emissions from land-use changes, avoiding competition with food crops, protecting biodiversity, and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples in that land (Energy Transitions Commission, 2021). Furthermore, while biofuels may have reduced the emissions intensity of the road transport sector in Brazil, the potential for further reductions in emissions by biofuel blending is limited (ICCT, 2023). Instead, full decarbonisation of the transport sector will require fast uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). Brazil has not set a specific target for electric vehicles and has not joined the COP27’s Accelerating to Zero coalition (A2Z), which states that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets.

According to the third yearbook on electric mobility, the sale of EVs has grown significantly in recent years. According to the latest estimates, around 2.5% of light-duty vehicles sold in 2022 were electric. The number of EVs sold in 2023 almost doubled compared to the previous year, a positive development that surpassed all projections (Audi, 2024; PNME, 2023). However, despite these positive development, there is still a long way to go. For comparison, the 1.5°C compatible share of EV sales in Brazil would need to be above 45% by 2030 (see figure below). Increasing electrification of the transport sector would also reduce Brazil’s dependency on biofuels, particularly those produced from soy, thereby reducing pressure on Brazilian land for soy farming (PNME, 2023).


### EV market share


## Agriculture

Agriculture is the second biggest contributor to Brazil’s GHG emissions after the land use sector (LULUCF), with emissions consistently growing over the years and reaching its highest reported levels in 2022 at just over 600 MtCO2e. Excluding LULUCF emissions, agriculture and livestock represent just over half of the country’s emissions. Almost 75% of the sector’s emissions are methane and nitrous oxide from livestock alone (SEEG, 2023a). If the indirect emissions of the agriculture sector (mostly related to deforestation resulting from the expansion of agricultural land) were considered, the sector would be by far the single largest emissions source in Brazil.

However, there are limited policies in place to reduce agricultural emissions. Brazil’s main policy instrument of agricultural activity is the Agricultural Plan (Plano Safra) which aims to facilitate sustainable development by providing credit lines tailored to support crop production and product marketing (CPI, 2023). The Plano Safra for 2023/2024, with a record allocation of BRL 435bn for agricultural financing, designates only 0.5% of this sum for low-carbon measures in the sector (Talanoa, 2023). Furthermore, the new Safra Plan 24/25, unveiled in the first half of 2024, has a 16.5% increase in investment credit lines. This the largest increase in public resources the Safra Plan has received so far (Government of Brazil, 2024).

Renovagro, formerly known as ABC+ Plan, supports low-carbon agriculture by financing practices such as land restoration, integrated crop-livestock-forest systems, the production of bio-fertilisers, and others. The ABC+ Plan aims to prevent over one billion tonnes of carbon emissions between 2021-2030, primarily through restoring degraded pastures and planting forests.

The Brazilian agricultural sector is heavily dependent on fertilisers. In November 2023, the government approved the revised National Fertiliser Plan 2050 aiming to reduce the country’s dependence on fertiliser imports — currently at 87% of total demand — and meet 45% to 50% of the demand domestically by 2050. The plan outlines strategies such as reactivating idle factories, incentivising new industrial plants, and investing in sustainable nutrient production to achieve the goal.

Historically, there is a strong relationship between agriculture expansion and deforestation emissions in Brazil. Forest land is consistently lost to make room for agriculture and cattle ranching. The expansion of soybean plantations became a direct driver of deforestation as it became more financially attractive than cattle ranching (Ionova, 2021). Forests are either directly converted to soybean farms, or soybeans are planted on old pasture, driving deforestation for more pastureland (Kimbrough, 2021).

However, expanding the agriculture frontier through deforestation is unnecessary to increase productivity. Brazil has considerable potential to add value and productivity to already available but currently underutilised land by investing in more sustainable and efficient agriculture methods (Observatório do Clima, 2019; Stabile et al., 2020).


## Forestry

Inventory emissions data available shows that the land use and forestry sector has been by far the largest source of GHG emissions in Brazil since the early 1990s. The year 2019 saw an area of over one million hectares deforested in the legal Amazon — 34% larger than in 2018, and 120% larger than the historical low reached in 2012 (INPE, 2020). In 2021, emissions from land use changed reached a new high — 10% higher than those reported for 2019 (SEEG, 2023a). The high deforestation rates are linked to a weakening of Brazil’s institutional and legal frameworks for environmental protection carried out by the previous administration. Weak land tenure enabled land grabbers to occupy and, in many cases, deforest undesignated public forests.

Preventing and combating deforestation stands as the biggest challenge for Brazil’s new administration. In this context, the Lula government launched a new edition of the Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) in June 2023, with a target to reach zero deforestation by 2030. With deforestation in the region projected to decrease by 75% to 80% by 2027 under this plan, Brazil aims to reverse the alarming trends observed, including the loss of 27,800 km2 of forest in 2021, marking the second-highest rate in history (Government of Brazil, 2023a; Talanoa, 2023).

This change in policy focus in Brazil's government is already yielding results. Recent studies reported a 36% drop in primary forest loss in Brazil in 2023, compared to 2022. However, deforestation still remains higher than in the early 2010s, with negative trends in some regions like the Cerrado region where deforestation actually increased by 6% in 2023 (BBC, 2024; Nature, 2023). The new PPCDAm includes a goal to reach zero deforestation by 2030 in the Cerrado, the region where the country’s agricultural land is expanding and the source of numerous major river basins, vital to the nation's water resources. In 2021, Brazil signed the COP26’s forestry pledge “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”.

Meeting Brazil’s NDC target will require that efforts to halt deforestation are accompanied by extensive reforestation and restoration of native forests. This can help Brazil to transition towards scenarios where the land use sector not only reduces emissions but also actively removes carbon from the atmosphere (Government of Brazil, 2023a; Talanoa, 2023).


## Methane

Brazil signed the methane pledge at COP26. At the time of joining the pledge, Brazil stood as the world's sixth-largest emitter of methane. Close to 30% of Brazil’s total GHG emissions incl. LULUCF are from methane, with more than 75% coming from agricultural activities, followed by energy and waste.

In March 2022, the federal government launched the ‘zero methane’ programme. However, it focuses primarily on actions to reduce emissions in the waste sector and to use methane for energy use, such as biogas and biomethane. In some sectors, such as meat production, this initiative was not well received. The Ministry of Agriculture stated that this measure would affect the economic growth of the sector. To date, Brazil lacks a public policy roadmap to guide its efforts in achieving the necessary methane reduction to fulfil its international commitment.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2020 are taken from Brazil’s annual estimated GHG emissions inventory (Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacaoes, 2022). We estimated emissions for 2021 and 2022 using the sectoral growth rates for each sector as reported by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals Estimation System (SEEG) initiative (SEEG, 2023b).

LULUCF emissions from 1990 to 2020 are taken directly from Brazil’s annual estimated GHG emissions inventory (Ministerio da Ciencia Tecnologia e Inovacaoes, 2022).


## NDC

The CAT rating of Brazil’s NDC is based on its 2030 target as communicated in their NDC submitted in October 2023 (Government of Brazil, 2023b). Brazil’s 2030 NDC target covers emissions from all sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6).

Brazil’s NDC provides an absolute emissions level for 2025 and 2030, including LULUCF, and is reported using AR5 GWP values. The CAT converted the emissions level for both 2025 and 2030 to AR4 GWP using a gas-by-gas and sector-by-sector approach to recalculate emissions from 2005 (baseline year) in AR4. This results in emissions levels of 1.30 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1.18 GtCO2e in 2030.

The CAT then proceeds to estimate and exclude emissions from the LULUCF sector. For this, we take LULUCF emissions for 2025 and 2030 as reported in the government’s report titled “Mitigation trajectories and public policy instruments to achieve Brazil's goals under the Paris Agreement” (Ministério da Ciência Tecnologia Inovações e Comunicações Brasil, 2017). The LULUCF emissions levels in 2025 and 2030 are 321 MtCO2e and 298 MtCO2e, respectively. These national projections for LULUCF do not include the current fluctuations in deforestation rates; if emissions from deforestation would rise again, Brazil would need to further reduce emissions in other sectors in order to meet their NDC target.

Our NDC estimates are highly dependent on the assumptions of the LULUCF contribution to overall emissions which, based on historical trends, can vary significantly. We use projections as reported by the government in 2017 for consistency and to allow for comparison between target updates in recent years. We expect additional clarity from Brazil on the role of LULUCF emissions in its targets for its next communication.


## Net zero target

Brazil has committed to being climate neutral by 2050. However, given the lack of additional details communicated so far, we were unable to provide an accurate estimate of what Brazil’s 2050 target means for the country’s emissions. Further clarity on sectoral contributions, assumptions on the role LULUCF would play in achieving the target and potential use of international carbon credits would be helpful to assess the comprehensiveness of the target.

We include Brazil in our ‘Optimistic scenario’ as part of our 2100 temperature warming estimate. We include a “CAT estimate” of Brazil’s climate neutrality target, which represents our assessment of what the target could represent. We assume that Brazil will achieve net zero by 2070 (excluding emissions from LULUCF) with a linear progression from the country’s last target (the 2030 NDC in 2030) to zero in 2070. This scenario translates into Brazil needing a sink of roughly 440 MtCO2e in 2050 to reach its carbon neutrality goal.


## Current policy projections

For the current policies scenario, we present a range which is calculated as described below.

Higher end of the range:

- Energy and Industry sector CO2 emissions are taken from the latest projections from the World Energy Outlook (IEA, 2023b).
- Energy, Industry, Agriculture and Waste sector non-CO2 emissions are taken from the US EPA “Non-CO2 GHG emissions” report with data available for the period between 1990 to 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).
- Other CO2 emissions from the agriculture sector are calculated based on the historical trend of the sector’s CO2 emissions (2013-2022).
- Other CO2 emissions for the waste sector are calculated by taking the average level of the last four years at 2022 levels.
- All of the above were harmonised to the last historical data point.
Lower end of the range:

Total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF taken from the 2023 Global Energy and Climate Outlook (JRC, 2023) and harmonised to the last historical data point.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

On 27 October 2023, the Brazilian government reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets it submitted when it joined the Paris Agreement in 2016, moving away from the NDC updates communicated by the Bolsonaro administration.

In this 2023 NDC, Brazil sets an unconditional target to limit emissions to 1.32 GtCO2e in 2025 and to 1.2 GtCO2e in 2030. This target covers all sectors and is reported using AR5 GWP values. The CAT excludes emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and converts it to AR4 GWP (see Assumptions section for more details), resulting in a 2025 target of up to 979 MtCO2e and a 2030 target of up to 884 MtCO2e. The CAT rates Brazil’s 2030 target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to both Brazil’s fair share and modelled domestic pathways.

In its NDC, Brazil includes a goal to reach climate neutrality by 2050 but they it not submitted an LTS or communicated further details on the target. In particular, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions in all sectors, including LULUCF.

## NDC Updates

In October 2023, Brazil resubmitted the emissions limits for 2025 and 2030 originally included in its first NDC of 2016. The government did not increase its mitigation ambition with this new submission, nor did it respond to the COP26 mandate to revisit and strengthen its 2030 targets.

In its 2023 submission, Brazil reconfirmed the 1.32 GtCO2e and 1.2 GtCO2e emission limits for 2025 and 2030, respectively. It noted that these limits are consistent with emission reductions of 48.4% and 53.1%, below 2005 levels based on the latest inventory data. While the emission limits are the same in the two submissions, we consider the nature of Brazil’s target formulation to have improved, given it now emphasises the emission limits, rather than percentage reduction targets.

Brazil is one of the few countries that has both a 2025 and 2030 target and has indicated that its next target will also be on a five-year scale to 2035. According to its NDC, Brazil will strive to meet its targets through domestic measures, but has not ruled out the use of international carbon markets. Brazil’s targets are not conditional on international support, though cooperation is welcome.

According to our calculations, Brazil will need to implement additional policies and actions to be able to reduce emissions and achieve its NDC targets.

* The difference in the CAT quantification of the original and 2023 NDC emissions limits is due to our conversion into AR4 values and the method use (see the Assumptions tab for details). The limits put forward by Brazil are the same.** Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("modelled domestic pathways"). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with its share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Brazil has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both its fair share contribution and the level of reductions needed in line with modelled domestic pathways.

The CAT assesses emissions excluding LULUCF. Our estimates of Brazil’s targets excluding LULUCF — and their corresponding rating — are highly dependent on the assumptions on the extent to which Brazil will rely on the sector to achieve its NDC. Brazil’s NDC mentions their commitment to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 but it does not give further details as to the expected emissions level for the sector in the future. We expect additional clarity from Brazil in its next communication.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its share of a global least-cost pathway limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

While the current NDC is stronger than the one submitted in 2022 under the previous administration, it is not enough to improve its rating against our modelled domestic pathways. Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and needs to adopt additional policies to cut its emissions.

Whether Brazil should receive climate finance from abroad to reduce its emissions is a matter of debate. Our methods do not provide a clear answer to this question. On balance, the CAT methodology shows Brazil needing a small amount of international support is technically consistent with a wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. However, this contribution would likely be small under most equity perspectives. As a result, the NDC target achieved with its own resources would still need to be improved to align more closely with the 1.5°C limit, regardless of international support.

NDC target against fair share

We rate Brazil’s 2030 NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. In 2023, Lula’s administration reverted to the original NDC's absolute emission targets submitted in 2016, which improved this rating by one category compared to the NDC submitted in 2022. However, according to our methodology, this new submission still falls short of being a fair contribution by Brazil to global climate action.

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Brazil’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Brazil’s target would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Brazil’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Brazil is not on track to achieve either its 2025 or 2030 targets and will need to adopt additional policies to cut their emissions.

## Net zero target

Brazil’s aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, a target reiterated in its 2023 NDC submission. However, no further details have been communicated so far, which limits our ability to assess the comprehensiveness of the target. As of August 2024, Brazil has not submitted a long-term strategy to the UNFCCC.

Aiming for climate neutrality by 2050 is a step in the right direction: transitioning to a low-emissions development pathway in compliance with international climate change commitments. However, Brazil should clearly state its plans for reducing emissions across all sectors of the economy, including LULUCF.
