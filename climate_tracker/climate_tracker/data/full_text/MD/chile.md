# Summary


## Overview

**Chile has made considerable progress on climate action over the past few years following the enactment of the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2022. This is reflected in the rapid rate of renewables expansion and the coal phase-out plan going faster than anticipated.** **With this update, the CAT’s overall rating of Chile’s climate targets and actions has improved to “Almost sufficient”, one of the few countries to earn this rating.**

**The impact of Chile’s coal phase-out could be lessened, however, if it results in higher natural gas consumption from planned reconversions. Eight coal-fired units have yet to make a retirement commitment: they are not obliged to stop operating until 2040. The implementation of measures in the energy end-use and other sectors, transport in particular, has also been occurring at a slower pace than what is needed to meet Chile’s commitments under its climate target (NDC) and related policy documents.**

According to our estimates, Chile's emissions have already peaked, in 2021, ahead of its 2025 commitment in the NDC. However, Chile will not be able to meet its 2030 NDC target under current policies. Chile’s upper end of its current policy projections also sits in the “Insufficient” range, meaning a lack of implementation of mitigation policies and increased natural gas consumption from retrofitting coal plants could result in a worse rating for Chile.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has finalised its National Mining Policy 2050, which includes a target for the industry sector to reach carbon neutrality by 2040, in addition to zero fleet and renewable electricity objectives. New laws to promote renewable energy and address critical barriers like the lack of transmission lines, such as the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility and the Energy Transition Law have been in the legislative process for a couple of years now.

Chile has also published new sectoral strategies to guide its short-term climate plans such as the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan, the Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, as well as the Green Hydrogen Action Plan 2023–2030. Chile has outlined its short-term measures for promoting its green hydrogen industry and becoming a top exporter by 2040 and is in the process of piloting its domestically produced hydrogen bus by early next year.

Chile’s coal phase-out is well on track, with some units retiring faster than expected. More than 1.2 GW of coal capacity from 11 plants has been retired since 2019. Another nine plants have made commitments to retire or convert to natural gas by the end of 2025. This is in line with the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan target to retire or reconvert 70% of coal-fired units by the end of 2025, representing 3.6 GW in capacity. Gas must still be phased out in the short-term, however, and Chile should be careful when repurposing plants to avoid carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C.

To accelerate its emission reductions to be aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, Chile could:

- **Revive discussions on shifting the national coal phase-out date from 2040 to 2030** to mandate the remaining eight coal-fired plants that have not made firm retirement commitments to have a more ambitious retirement date.
- **Decrease economic incentives for fossil fuels.** Chile’s carbon tax is considered relatively ineffective due to its low carbon price, while diesel fuel is still subsidised for internal combustion engines (ICE).
- **Implement concrete mitigation measures in the energy end-use, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors** so that they can also contribute to emissions reductions leading up to 2030.
- **Rapidly increase the pace of reforestation and sustainable forest management** for Chile to meet its LULUCF commitments under its NDC and maintain the sector’s crucial status as a considerable sink. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on increasing its LULUCF sink to meets its climate targets, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance, and should instead prioritise emissions reductions in all other sectors.
Since our previous assessment, the positive developments in Chile’s climate policies include:

- Accelerating the pace of the coal phase-out since its initial announcement in 2019, with the Ministry of Energy announcing its intentions for 70% of coal plants to be retired or retrofitted by 2025.
- The Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, which aims to address the infrastructure gaps that are hindering EV uptake.
- Chile has put a large focus on the just transition of the coal phase-out to promote job creation, new investments, and participatory planning in affected communities, including in the Ministry of Energy’s recent Decarbonisation Plan.
- Explicitly including a link between biodiversity and climate mitigation in its NDC.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

**The CAT rates Chile’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements.

Chile is almost meeting its “fair share” contributions to climate change mitigation. Chile’s unconditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair share. Chile’s conditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, Chile could strengthen its climate policies and set slightly more ambitious conditional and unconditional NDC targets.

**Chile’s current policies are "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways.** This rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

According to our assessment, emissions under Chile’s currently implemented policies would reach between 100–108 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels, when emissions peaked). This emissions level is also insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO2e). Chile needs to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5° compatible.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has continued to shut down coal plants according to its phase-out plan. Over 1.2 GW of coal capacity from eleven plants has been retired since 2019 and an additional nine units have committed to retire or convert to natural gas between 2024 and 2025. Up to five of these units are expected to be retrofitted for gas.

While considered a “transition fuel” by the Chilean government, fossil gas is still a fossil fuel that the CAT estimates needs to be completely phased out by 2035 to remain on a global 1.5°C pathway. Therefore, Chile must be careful when repurposing its coal-fired plants to gas, as this could create either a carbon lock-in - or a risk of being left with stranded assets.

While there were discussions around bringing forward the coal phase-out year to 2030, it has not been mentioned for some time and recent policy documents reference the 2040 phase-out date. An early coal phase-out, where electricity generation is replaced by renewable sources rather than fossil gas, would significantly impact Chile’s current policies pathway and bring it considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory and be aligned with CAT’s power sector benchmarks.

The transport sector makes up a significant share of Chile’s total GHG emissions, especially as its energy consumption continues to increase. The Electromobility Strategy, Energy Efficiency Law, and ban on ICE cars by 2035 are key policies expected to accelerate the low-carbon transportation transition, but Chile’s EV sales have yet to exceed 1%. More should be done to encourage EV uptake and decrease energy demand in the sector, for instance, by reforming diesel fuel subsidies and a modal shift in transportation, so that Chile does not fall behind on its transport electrification targets.

Maintaining the LULUCF sink is an important component of Chile’s climate targets which is threatened by the increased frequency and severity of wildfires related to climate change. While Chile has ambitious commitments for reforestation and sustainable forest management in its NDC, the pace of implementation has been far too slow, and stronger policies to support reforestation and forest management are needed.

Full policies and action analysis can be found here.

**We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions from 2016 values by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Chile’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals.

To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could improve its 2030 target from 45% to roughly 67% to reach an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it.

**We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target – the absolute emissions target of 95 MtCO****2****e excluding LULUCF in 2030 – as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action.** This rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” from our previous update. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition compared to our previous assessment.

Chile has large forested areas, and although emissions have fluctuated strongly, e.g. because major wildfires swept across the country in 2017, Chile’s LULUCF sinks over the last 20 years absorbed, on average, roughly two-thirds of total emissions. Chile should work toward maintaining this LULUCF sink, but it is far from meeting its ambitious reforestation and sustainable forest management commitments in its NDC. For more information about forestry activities in Chile, please see the LULUCF tab under Policies and Actions.

**We evaluate Chile’s net zero target** as** “Acceptable”.** Chile’s currently proposed net zero target for 2050 covers most key elements and is now also Legally Binding through the Framework Law. Chile’s target covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses.

Chile plans to heavily rely on negative emissions by forests to reach its net zero target, expecting carbon sinks to contribute as much as 50% of the emissions reduction required to reach the 2050 neutrality goal (Gobierno de Chile, 2021).

It is therefore extremely important to assure that forests keep acting as sinks and do not turn into emission sources, a risk that can only partly be mitigated by policies, as not only human activity but natural factors, and increasingly the effects of climate change via more extreme and frequent heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, can turn removals from LULUCF to emissions. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits to make this clearer.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

**We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable.**

Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, Chile included this target in the LTS and it was enshrined in law in June 2022 with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).

Chile’s net zero target covers most key elements. It covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses and budgets. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits.

Chile could further improve its net zero target by considering good practice standards for a few elements. It could include international aviation and shipping in its target’s scope, and explicitly elaborate on fairness considerations.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and no removals outside borders

Net zero target in law

Separate emission reduction and removal targets

Legally binding process to review the net zero target

Transparent assumptions or pathways only for removals or only for LULUCF

Underlying (governmental or government-endorsed) analysis that identifies a pathway to and key measures for reaching net zero. The analysis includes sector-specific detail

Country makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target


## CAT analysis of net zero target

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Chile aims to reach net zero by 2050 (President of Chile, 2020).
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers) (President of Chile, 2020).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Chile provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions or removals outside its borders. Neither Chile’s NDC nor its underlying pathways towards 2050 explicitly rule out international credits (Government of Chile, 2020a; Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Chile passed its net zero target in the Climate Change Framework Law (Ley Marco de Cambio Climatico, 21455) on 13 June 2022 (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Chile specifies separate emissions reductions and removal targets by specifying the contribution of LULUCF in 2030 and 2050. (Government of Chile, 2020b; Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Review process** – Chile has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target (long-term strategy) and sectoral plans.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Chile provides transparent pathways for carbon dioxide removal from domestic LULUCF sinks through 2050 and assumes no technical carbon removals and storage in the timeframe up to 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – Chile provides intermediate carbon budgets as well as sector specific targets in their NDC. The NDC provides several carbon neutrality scenarios per sector and highlights the necessary measures, such as reaching a 58% share of electric vehicles among private and commercial vehicles by 2050, replacing thermal power stations with renewable energy systems, and installing electric heating in public and commercial buildings. The strategy also establishes an emissions peak no later than 2025 and sets a maximum budget for cumulative emissions from 2020–2030 (Government of Chile, 2020b). The NDC further defines clear visions for 2030 and 2050 and Chile provides detailed pathway analyses (Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Chile makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target in the climate change framework law nor in the long-term strategy.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

**Chile has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been officially submitted to the UNFCCC, we will publish our full assessment here.**


# Policies & action

**Chile’s current policies are almost sufficient when rated against modelled domestic pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Chile’s upper end of its current policy projections sits in the “Insufficient” range, meaning a lack of implementation of mitigation policies and increased natural gas consumption from retrofitting coal plants could result in a worse rating for Chile. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

According to our assessment, emissions under Chile’s currently implemented policies would reach 100–108 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels). The CAT estimates that Chile reached peak emissions in 2021, ahead of the 2025 target in its NDC. However, this emissions level is still insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO2e), let alone be on a 1.5°C trajectory. Chile will need to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has continued to shut down coal plants according to its phase-out plan. Over 1.2 GW of coal capacity from 11 plants has been retired since 2019 and an additional nine units have committed to retire or convert to natural gas between 2024 and 2025. While considered a “transition fuel” by the Chilean government, gas is still a fossil fuel that needs to be phased out – therefore, Chile must be careful when repurposing the plants to avoid the risk of carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).

While there were discussions in August 2022 around bringing forward the coal phase-out year to 2030, it has not been mentioned in the Second Phase of the Energy Transition strategy released in 2023 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022a). An early coal phase-out, where electricity generation is replaced by renewable sources rather than fossil gas, could significantly impact Chile’s current policies pathway and bring it considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory.

The transport sector makes up a significant share of Chile’s total GHG emissions, especially as its energy consumption continues to increase. The Electromobility Strategy, Energy Efficiency Law, and ban on ICE cars by 2035 are key policies expected to accelerate the low-carbon transportation transition, but Chile’s EV sales have yet to exceed 1%. More could be done to encourage EV uptake and decrease energy demand, for instance, by reforming diesel fuel subsidies and a incentivising a modal shift in transportation.

Maintaining the LULUCF sink is an important component of Chile’s climate targets, which is threatened by the increased frequency and severity of wildfires related to climate change. While Chile has ambitious commitments for reforestation and sustainable forest management in its NDC, the pace of implementation has been far too slow, and stronger policies to support reforestation and forest management are needed. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks for its targets and prioritise cutting emissions in other sectors.

## Policy overview

Between 2010 and 2022, Chile’s emissions increased by 27%, from 88 MtCO2e to 112 MtCO2e, excluding LULUCF. When considering Chile’s current policies, we estimate that Chile’s emissions already peaked in 2021 at a level of 115 MtCO2e. According to our assessment, Chile’s emissions levels in 2030 under current policies will be between 100–108 MtCO2e/year (excl. LULUCF). Our analysis suggests that Chile will not meet its conditional nor unconditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies, or be 1.5° compatible.

Compared to our previous assessment, emissions under current policies have increased due to higher historical emissions than previously projected, a stronger rebound after COVID, and changes to the current policy assumptions.

Chile’s key climate policies include the Energy Efficiency Law (Law 21.305/2021), a legal framework aiming to reduce energy consumption across the power, transport, buildings, and industry sectors. It also includes the coal phase-out, where all of Chile’s coal-fired units (28) are expected to retire or be retrofitted by 2040. An earlier coal phase-out could have a sizable impact on Chile’s current policy trajectory, but only if the coal capacity is replaced with generation from renewable energy sources. The CAT estimates that choosing to retrofit coal plants with gas could lead to at least 3 MtCO2e fewer in emission reductions in the short-term compared to retiring coal-fired units and using renewable electricity sources, and can lead to carbon lock-in risks and stranded assets.

The Electromobility Strategy guides climate policy in the transport sector and sets out an action plan to electrify 100% of the urban public transport vehicle fleet by 2050 and ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines in 2035. Chile has also introduced a carbon tax (Law 20.780/2014), although its price is likely too low to result in emissions reductions.

In June 2022, Chile passed the Framework Law on Climate Change (21455) (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022). It includes the 2050 GHG neutrality target and recognises the NDC target, making them legally binding. As a result, Chile now has a legal framework that assigns responsibilities and strengthens the legal and institutional basis for implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation policies across all sectors, and is moving towards a low emissions economy. It also presents a paradigm shift in Chile’s environmental policy, as climate action is now not only the responsibility of the environment ministry but is spread across 17 national ministries, as well as regional governments and municipalities, and even includes the private sector.

While most of the important regulations outlined in the Framework Law on Climate Change have come into force, Chile has been delayed in implementing two new regulations and modifying two existing regulations (Peña, 2024). The regulation on its Article 6 framework is heading into its consultation stage, but there has been no movement on its related law outlining the requirements and verification method around the GHG emissions reduction or absorption certificates. The law also mandates the relevant ministries to develop sectoral mitigation plans by 2024, but no plans have yet been released (CR2 and Centro de Derecho Ambiental, 2024).

Since our previous assessment, there have been no major changes to Chile’s climate policies. New laws to promote renewable energy and address critical barriers like a lack of transmission lines, such as the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility and the Energy Transition Law, have been in the legislative process for a couple of years now.

Chile has nevertheless made progress in that time, publishing new sectoral strategies to guide its short-term climate plans such as the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan, the Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, as well as the Green Hydrogen Action Plan 2023-2030.

Chile is on track with its 2040 coal phase-out plan, meeting its goal of retiring 11 plants by 2024, and has even accelerated its implementation. Nine of the remaining coal-fired units have currently committed to being retired or retrofitted between 2024 and 2025, although it is unclear whether the retirement or reconversion will be timely. However, the eight remaining coal plants have yet to make a firm commitment: it is still possible for them to continue operating until 2040. While there were some discussions in 2022 on adopting an even earlier, more ambitious phase-out date of 2030, this has not been mentioned in a while. To bring its current policies considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory, Chile could update its national commitment to phase out coal-fired power by 2030.


## Power sector

The power sector is Chile's largest emitting sector, accounting for 27% of total GHG emissions, or 39% of energy sector emissions. The general share of electricity production sources in 2023 was around 29% hydropower, 20% solar, 17% coal, 18.5% fossil gas, 11% wind power, 4% other fossil fuels, and 0.5% of other renewables (Ember, 2024). Fossil fuels have made up two-thirds to a half of electricity generation since 2000, with hydropower accounting for the remaining share up to 2014. Since 2021, hydropower generation has notably dropped, which can be attributed to both drought conditions and the uptake of other renewable sources (i.e. wind and solar) (Revista Energética de Chile, 2022).

Chile has several key strategies and policies guiding its energy planning. The updated Energy Strategy, titled Chile’s Energy Transition (also known as PEN for Política Energética Nacional), was published in March 2022, and replaces the previous 2050 Energy Strategy from 2017. It sets a long-term vision for energy planning and provides a roadmap including 66 targets covering various sectors.

Targets have become substantially more ambitious than in the previous iteration: the targeted renewables share in electricity generation has increased from 60% by 2035 to 80% by 2030 and from 70% to 100% by 2050, setting out the new goal of a 100% renewable power system for the first time (Ministerio de Energía, 2015, 2022c). According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, Chile should achieve a more ambitious renewables share between 96–98% in 2030 and decarbonise by 2035 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

A follow-up roadmap to the Energy Route 2018–2022, the other key ministerial document, known as PELP 2023–2027 (Planificación Energética de Largo Plazo) was released last year. It includes three modelled pathways, one based on current policies that assumes the 2030 NDC target will be reached, and two more ambitious pathways aiming at GHG neutrality by 2050 and earlier.

The Energy Efficiency Law (Ley de Eficiencia Energética, Law No. 21.305) was officially established as a legal framework for energy efficiency in February 2021. The law aims to foster energy efficiency and covers the industry, mining, transport, and buildings sectors, thereby reducing total final energy consumption by 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 in addition to various sectoral-level targets. It will play a central role in reaching net zero emissions in 2050 and also in achieving mid-term targets, and claims to lead to a reduction of 28.6 MtCO2e by 2030 (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d).

Chile has also implemented a carbon tax of 5 USD/tCO2 for stationary sources (turbines or boilers above 50 MWth­), which came into effect in 2017. Payments for 2017 began in April 2018 and accounted for more than USD 190m (El Mercurio, 2018). In 2021, the tax covered 32.5% of GHG emissions. As of 2022, Chile’s carbon tax is applicable to all ‘large emitters’ (>25 ktCO2e/year) without any sectoral exclusions (OECD, 2024). However, Chile’s carbon tax is considered to be relatively ineffective due to its low prices.

Both the current policy and 2050 Energy Strategy scenarios from the Mitigation Plan include considerable generation from hydro — which accounted for 28.5% of generation in 2023 (Ember, 2024). The construction of large hydropower projects in Chile is highly controversial, largely because of significant adverse environmental and social impacts. In 2014, Chile’s government overturned environmental permits for HidroAysén, a massive hydroelectric project in Patagonia, after a seven year campaign against it - the largest environmental campaign in Chile’s history (NRDC, 2016).


### Coal

In June 2019, Chile announced its plans to completely phase out coal by 2040 and aim for GHG neutrality by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2019). In line with this announcement, Chile signed the coal exit agreement and all of its clauses at COP26 and also prominently disclosed it in its updated NDC.

Since then, the coal phase-out has been progressing considerably faster than anticipated. The number of power plants to be shut by 2024 was increased to 11 in a 2020 updated plan (Ministerio de Energía, 2020c). In January 2024, the Ministry of Energy presented its Decarbonisation Plan, including a goal to retire or retrofit (with gas) 70%, or about 20, of Chile’s coal plants by the end of 2025 (Ministerio de Energía, 2023c).

The accelerated coal phase-out plan, while a very positive development, would mean Chile’s remaining coal-fired units are those without any concrete retirement commitments. At the moment, they are not obligated to stop operating until 2040, meaning that Chile could still use coal to meet its electricity demands until then. According to the CAT, an earlier coal phase-out date would align Chile with a 1.5°C global pathway (see graph). An early coal phase-out would also help bring Chile’s policies considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory if coal plants are completely retired in place of retrofitting them into natural gas plants (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

As of July 2024, Chile has successfully retired 11 power plants with around 1.2 GW of installed capacity, achieving the 2024 goal. In 2023, only one coal-fired unit from the Ventanas power plant was retired, while in April 2024, the Norgener 1 and Norgener 2 units (totaling 276 MW) in Tocopilla were disconnected much earlier than their scheduled December 2025 date (Global Energy Monitor, 2024; Pizzoleo, 2024). After the approval of the Norgener plants’ retirement, however, the energy provider requested to continue operating in order to burn its remaining coal stock (Muñoz, 2024).

The first part of Chile’s Just Transition Strategy puts a focus on the retirement of coal plants. It aims to promote new job opportunities and investments, avoid significant increases in electricity rates, and develop new industries in communities that would be affected by the closure of coal plants. The strategy emphasises a participatory process with affected stakeholders and its implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Committee (Ministerio de Energía, 2021a).

Nine of the remaining coal-fired units have made commitments to retire or reconvert between 2024 and 2025 (Ministerio de Energía, 2023c). However, the owners of the eight remaining units, representing 1.9 GW of coal capacity, have yet to make a firm commitment, so it is still possible for them to continue operating until the 2040 national commitment date (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

In August 2022, when the energy minister presented the new Energy Agenda 2022, he mentioned that discussions were ongoing for an even more ambitious plan to retire all coal power plants by 2030 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022a), but these plans have not been mentioned in a while. In April 2023, the Ministry of Energy launched the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, where only the 2040 coal phase-out was referenced. An early coal phase-out would help bring Chile’s policies on track to being 1.5° compatible. According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, a 2030 phase-out would also align Chile with the global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Although some plants were shut down six to 12 months after the planned date, Chile’s coal phase-out plan has gone beyond its initial expectations. Chile should, however, be careful when retrofitting its coal power plants with gas. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).


### Fossil gas and oil

Fossil gas has made up 15–20% of Chile’s electricity generation over the past 10 years (Ember, 2024). Chile produces less than 20% of its total gas supply, and primarily relies on imports, but expects to increase its fossil gas production in the coming years. For instance, in February 2024, a Chilean energy company signed a deal with a California-based gas technology company to boost production by up to 200% (Geiger, 2024). There is no room for new investments in fossil fuel activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).

Chile’s coal phase-out allows for power plants to convert to fossil gas power generation in place of complete retirement (Deza, 2024). Fossil gas should only play a minor role in Paris Agreement-compatible pathways: according to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, fossil gas should only make up 1–4% of Chile’s electricity generation in 2030 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). This also raises questions around energy security, seeing as Chile continues to import most of its fossil gas.


### Renewables

Hydropower has historically accounted for a considerable share of Chile’s electricity production, accounting for almost 50% of electricity generated in 2000, but its share has decreased to 28.5% in 2023 and has been replaced by the rapid deployment of wind and solar (Ember, 2024). While wind and solar power made up less than 0.1% of electricity generation in 2013, their shares have significantly increased to 11% and 20% of total electricity production, respectively, in the past ten years.

Chile has set out a target of achieving an 80% share of renewable electricity generation by 2030 and 100% by 2050. According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, Chile should achieve a more ambitious renewables share between 96–98% in 2030 and decarbonise by 2035 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (see graph) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Various laws to foster renewable energy growth have been passed or are in the legislative process. The Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility (Law 21.505), published in 2022, will enable storage systems that are separate from generation facilities to be paid for providing energy to the grid, especially in times in high demand. One of the main objectives of this law is to reduce the reliance on coal by improving the energy security of the electricity system (Ministerio de Energía, 2022b).

The Energy Transition Law is a legislative initiative that will serve as an intermediary step for the structural reforms needed to achieve Chile’s carbon neutrality goal. Its three main pillars are promoting the efficient development of transmission projects, enabling the buildout of key infrastructure, and encouraging the competitive advancement of energy storage. The Bill Promoting Renewable Energies in the Electricity Matrix aims to establish renewable energy quotas for new electricity contracts, gradually increasing until reaching 60% in 2030 (Medinilla, 2023).

As a measure to foster decentralised renewable energy deployment, in early 2018, Chile reformed its Distributed Generation Law (also referred to as the “Net Billing” Law) (Law 20.571). The reform included a tripling of installed capacity from 100 kW to 300 kW, which aims to support and promote larger projects of self-consumption of electricity (Ministerio de Energía, 2018). Electricity surplus can be fed into the grid to obtain discounts in the owner’s electricity bill. The reform establishes, that if an owner has more than one establishment, these discounts are also applicable for those electricity bills. Otherwise, discounts from surplus can be accumulated.


### Green hydrogen

Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy, published in late 2020, set goals for Chile to produce the lowest-cost green hydrogen by 2030 and become a top three global exporter by 2040 (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a). Hydrogen plays a significant role in Chile’s carbon neutrality strategy, and is expected to contribute a quarter of the necessary emissions reductions in 2050 (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).

The strategy emphasises green hydrogen’s role in the decarbonisation of the transport, mining, and agriculture sectors. One of its first objectives is to use green hydrogen in heavy and long-distance transportation, and later to also replace liquid fuels in land transportation and aviation. Green hydrogen and its derivatives are also expected to be incorporated in the industry sector and produce green ammonia for low-carbon fertiliser production (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a).

To operationalise the Hydrogen Strategy, Chile published its Green Hydrogen Action Plan in April 2024, which outlines short-term measures to promote green hydrogen production and utilisation (Gobierno de Chile, 2024). A significant number of actions are focused around developing the enabling infrastructure for the green hydrogen industry and its regulatory and financial support. In the transport sector, a public-private partnership is in the process of developing Chile’s first locally-made hydrogen bus, which is expected to be piloted by the first half of 2025 (Gobierno de Chile, 2023c). The plan also explores converting thermal plants to run on hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuels through co-combustion or blending (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).


## Industry

Chile is the world’s leading copper exporter, and the mining and industry sector is Chile’s largest consumer of final energy, accounting for 36% of energy consumption in 2021 and approximately 17% of total GHG emissions (IEA, 2024a). In 2021, 44% of mining electricity consumption came from renewable sources, and it is estimated that it will reach 62% in 2025.

Chile has established several targets to minimise emissions from the mining and industry sector in its energy strategy (PEN). They include:

- an emissions reduction target of 70% of direct GHG emissions from fuel use in the industry and mining sector by 2050 below 2018 levels,
- an improvement of energy intensity of large energy consumers by at least 25% in 2050 below 2021,
- a requirement that at least 90% of energy for heating and cooling in industry must come from sustainable sources by 2050,
- a goal of 100,000 new energy jobs by 2030, direct and indirect, from sustainable energy projects in new energy-related industries, and
- a requirement that 100% of medium and large companies in Chile must implement effective and monitorable energy efficiency and/or renewable energy measures.
These measures are also featured in Chile’s LTS (Gobierno de Chile, 2021; Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).

Mining companies themselves play an important role in meeting these targets. The Chilean Copper Commission (COCHILCO) has carried out surveys and compiled data on GHG emissions and energy consumption, the Green Mining Roundtable was launched in 2019, and the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) has supported the deployment of hydrogen vehicles for mining (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a). The deployment of green hydrogen and its derivatives in the mining sector is a key component of Chile’s Green Hydrogen Strategy and Action Plan (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).

The National Mining Policy 2050, developed by the Ministry of Mining, was approved in early 2023, and includes several objectives related to GHG emissions and environmental considerations. Notably, it includes a target to reduce emissions from large mining operations by at least 50% by 2030, and to become a carbon-neutral industry by 2040. It also outlines a zero-emissions fleet plan to be released by 2025 and implemented by 2030, as well as an objective for 90% of electricity contracts to come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2050 (Gobierno de Chile, 2023a). Along with being responsible for the monitoring and implementation of the above, the Ministry of Mining is also directed to establish GHG emissions targets for scope 1, 2, and 3 that comply with the 2030 target.

Among the provisions of the new Energy Efficiency Law approved in early 2021 is the promotion of energy management in the country's largest consumers. These include all large companies with consumption over 50 Tcal per year (210 TJ/yr), cumulatively accounting for more than one third of the country’s consumed energy. These so-called consumers with energy management capacity have to implement an energy management system that covers at least 80% of their emissions and will additionally have to prepare an annual public report on several performance indicators, including energy consumption and energy intensity (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d; Ministerio de Hacienda: Oficina de Partes, 2021)


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for a third of Chile’s total final energy consumption (34%) in 2021, almost the same as the industry sector, as well as a third (33%) of its total GHG emissions, considering 99% of the sector’s energy consumption is from imported fossil fuels (IEA, 2023).

As with other sectors, Chile has established a number of targets to minimise emissions from the transport sector in its energy strategy (PEN). The most prominent target is that 100% of new light- and medium-duty vehicles sales must be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. In line with this target, at COP26 Chile signed the declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% EVs. However, Chile is not on progress to meet this target: its EV sales have yet to exceed 1% as of 2024. For Chile to achieve its transport electrification ambitions, it needs additional policies to support EV uptake.

In December 2017, Chile published its Electromobility Strategy, which sets out a goal and action plan towards achieving a 40% share of electric passenger vehicles as well as a 100% electrified public transport fleet by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2017a). Chile’s Energy Strategy (PEN, or Política Energética Nacional), published in 2022, updated these targets and made them more ambitious, aiming for 100% zero emission vehicles in public transport and urban public transport by 2040, and 60% of private and commercial vehicles to be zero emissions by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).

Other transport goals include a 40% reduction in direct GHG emissions from the use of fuels in the sector (including land, sea, and air transport) by 2050 compared to 2018 (20% by 2040). Chile’s Energy Route 2018–2022 set out a short-term goal of a 10-fold increase in EVs in 2022 (compared to 2017 levels). While this was overachieved by more than double, the target was relative to a very low initial EV stock in 2017 at only 231 cars (Ministerio de Energía, 2021e; IEA, 2024b).

Chile is already beginning to implement actions towards achieving these targets. As of April 2024, Chile has reportedly reached over 2,500 electric buses in its public transport system, representing 38% of its total fleet (Carrara, 2024). Electric buses now represent around one-fifth of total bus sales in the country (IEA, 2024c). At the same time, the market share of EVs remains low, and decreased in past year from 0.5% to 0.3% of vehicles sold in 2023, and EVs make up only 0.1% of the total car fleet. EV sales have more than doubled, however, compared to 2019 and increased five-fold in the past six years, indicating a rapid upward trend. Public charging infrastructure is rather limited, with only 1,070 units (up from 660 in 2022) units in 2023 (compared to e.g., 51,000 in Germany) (IEA, 2024b).

In addition to promoting renewables in the energy matrix, the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility (21.505) includes measures to encourage EV uptake. The law includes temporary exemptions or reductions for driving permit fees for electric and hybrid vehicles, thus matching those of ICE vehicles, and enables battery EVs to connect to the grid and store energy (Ministerio de Energía, 2022b).

Building on the Electromobility Strategy, in 2023, Chile presented its Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility. This plan contains concrete measures to 2026 aimed at accelerating the EV transition and addressing Chile’s current EV infrastructure gap. Its main pillars are building a robust public infrastructure charging network, promoting public transportation and decentralisation in priority regions, and improving EV education and road safety (Gobierno de Chile, 2023b).

The Energy Efficiency Law also targets the transport sector. It establishes energy efficiency standards for imported vehicles, which came into effect this year, and government subsidies are offered for electric taxis and home charging points. It aims to ensure interoperability of the EV charging system, facilitates access and connection to the charging network, and allows the Ministry of Transport to establish energy efficiency standards for vehicles (Ministerio de Energía, 2021c).

Building on its Green Hydrogen Strategy, the government has also presented its Sustainable Aviation Fuels 2050 Roadmap (SAF 2050). The roadmap sets out a goal of achieving 50% of SAF use in aviation by 2050 by promoting local, decentralised production of new energy sources. including biofuels and green hydrogen (Ministerio de Energía, 2024).

Chile’s electromobility targets, initial implemented measures, and the 2035 ban of non-EV sales are a great step in the right direction, especially since they are integrated into new strategies and laws such as the Energy Efficiency Law and Green Hydrogen Strategy. However, additional policies, especially targeting private car ownership, are needed to meet both these targets and global decarbonisation benchmarks, which foresee having only zero emission cars on the road by 2050 to be compatible with limiting temperature to 1.5°C (Climate Action Tracker, 2016). For the development of an integral policy making framework for transport, it is of great importance to consider social and economic consequences of the different policy options. The total emissions reduction potential of transport electrification also significantly depends on the decarbonisation of the electricity supply used to charge vehicles.


## Buildings

Buildings consumed almost a quarter of the country's total energy in 2021, with a significant share of this used for heating, and were responsible for approximately 7% of Chile’s total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) in the same year (Comisión Nacional de Energía, 2021; Ministerio de Energía, 2022c; IEA, 2024a). It is therefore not surprising that the buildings sector is a central part of the Chile’s cross-sectoral Energy Efficiency Law.

The law establishes that residential buildings, public buildings, commercial buildings, and office buildings must have an energy rating to be commercialised (i.e. put on the market): this is applicable to construction and real estate companies as well as housing and urban planning services. As with appliances such as refrigerators, the energy efficiency label allows people to have better information when renting or buying homes. The label must be included in all sales advertising by companies (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d). This provision builds upon the existing Calificación Energética de Viviendas (CEV), established in 2011, and is also integrated into voluntary national building sustainability certifications (Ministerio de Energía, 2021b).

The Energy Efficiency Law also states that companies with high energy consumption (over 50 tcal) must annually report their energy consumption and energy intensity. It also introduces an Energy Management System (EMS), covering at least 80% of total energy consumption that includes an energy efficiency action plan, goals, and performance indicators. In 2023, the list of companies that must apply these regulations was published (Ministerio de Energía, 2023b).

As with other sectors, Chile’s energy strategy (PEN) also established a number of targets to minimise emissions from the buildings sector, including:

- a requirement that 10% of existing homes have a specific standard for thermal regulation by 2050, which should point towards net zero energy buildings;
- that 100% of new public buildings are "zero net energy consuming" by 2030, considering optimal energy performance of heating, hot water, cooling and lighting systems;
- that 100% of new residential and non-residential buildings are “zero net energy consumption” by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).
Even prior to the updated PEN and the Energy Efficiency Law, Chile has been pursuing strategies for the buildings sector such as the National Strategy for Sustainable Construction (ENCS), its main objectives being to incorporate sustainability criteria into buildings and infrastructure, reduce the sector’s energy consumption, reduce GHG emissions, and promote renewable energy use in construction (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo, 2013). In addition to being revalidated, the ENCS is currently in the process of being updated to respond to new national and international commitments, and better account for the impacts of climate change (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo, 2024).

Chile has also implemented different financial incentives and support programmes to improve building energy efficiency. For instance, under Law no. 20.571/2016, Chile aims to incentivise the use of solar heating through tax cuts for developers who implement this technology (Ministerio de Energía, 2017b). In 2023, the energy and housing ministries introduced subsidies for families to implement solar heating, photovoltaic systems, thermal insulation, and to replace wood-burning heaters (Ministerio de Energía, 2023a).


## Methane

Chile signed the methane pledge at COP26. Chile’s methane emissions have remained relatively stable in recent decades, accounting for 15 MtCO2e in 2022 or 14% of total emissions (down from 24% in 1990) (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023). The agriculture (38%) and waste (51%) sectors account for most of Chile’s methane emissions, with a smaller share coming from the energy sector (11%).

A 30% cut in methane emissions would therefore translate into roughly 4 MtCO2e or 4% of total emissions, which would further increase Chile’s chances of meeting its NDC target. As Chile has not yet submitted an updated NDC since signing this pledge, it is not included in its NDC. Nevertheless, Chile’s NDC specifically states that methane is considered in the GHG target, and includes a measure on building new waste treatment plants that better manage methane by 2035 (Government of Chile, 2020a). Chile’s former environmental minister Marcelo Mena is leading the Global Methane Hub, a hub which offers grants and technical support to implement the Global Methane Pledge.

Chile has over 20 Mha of tree cover and therefore has great natural sinks, particularly in the south of the country (Global Forest Watch, 2024). Although having lost 2.35 Mha, or 12%, in the last 20 years, on average Chile’s LULUCF sinks made up roughly two-thirds of its other emissions (Global Forest Watch, 2024). Net emissions from the sector have ranged from -48 to -78 MtCO2e between 1990 to 2020, with the exception of 2017. Chile should work toward maintaining this LULUCF sink.

Whereas the emission reductions from LULUCF sinks remained relatively stable from 1990 until 2016, the LULUCF sector became an emissions source of 15 MtCO2e in 2017, which can directly be attributed to some of Chile’s worst wildfires in modern history that swept across the country (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2020). This shows how vulnerable these sinks are to extreme weather events, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity. The summer of 2023 was another destructive period with over 400 kha of forest burned (OECD, 2024). CO2 removal through LULUCF is a central part of Chile’s strategy to become GHG neutral in 2050. Therefore, it is extremely important to assure that forests keep acting as sinks and do not turn into emission sources.

At COP26, Chile signed the Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use. While Chile has not updated its NDC since, the sector plays a key role in its current target. In its NDC, Chile committed to a 25% emissions reduction in the forestry sector by 2030, the sustainable management and recovery of 200,000 hectares of native forests, and the afforestation of an additional 200,000 hectares. These actions are estimated to account for 3.9 to 4.6 MtCO2e of annual removals by 2030 (Government of Chile, 2020a). The NDC also commits to identifying peatland and other wetland areas in the national inventory and evaluating their capacity for climate change adaptation or mitigation by 2030.

Chile’s 2020 NDC references the National Strategy for Climate Change and Vegetation Resources (ENCCRV), established in 2013 by the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) through the National Forest Corporation (CONAF), as one of the main tools in reaching the different targets on mitigation related to LULUCF, along with regulations and instruments granting incentives for forest owners to preserve or create new forests. Further, the NDC states that its afforestation target should be in line with Law Nº20.283 on Native Forest Recovery and Forest Promotion, under which afforestation is only undertaken in lands without vegetation and cannot be a substitution of native forests (Government of Chile, 2020a).

However, Chile’s current pace of implementing its LULUCF targets is significantly slower than what is needed to meet its commitments under its NDC. Between 2020 and 2022, only 2 kha were reforested, meaning an additional 198 kha of land would need to be reforested in the next eight years. Similarly, sustainable forest management activities have occurred on only 35 kha of native forests and if this trend continues, Chile will only reach 15% of its target by 2030 (Cortés Lehuei, 2024). Thus, stronger policies to promote reforestation and sustainable native forest management would be needed for Chile to meet its LULUCF targets set under its NDC. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to meets its climate targets, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance, and should instead prioritise emissions reductions in all other sectors.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2022 were taken from the PRIMAP National Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions Database (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023). The data is provided in AR4.

LULUCF data from 1990 to 2020 is taken from the Greenhouse Gas Inventory presented alongside Chile’s Fifth Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

No assumptions or calculations were made with respect to the unconditional NDC target for 2030 as it already included an absolute target for emissions excl. LULUCF. The NDC also included a peak year (2025) and an emissions budget (excl. LULUCF) for the period between 2020 and 2030 (Government of Chile, 2020a). These numbers were taken directly into our calculations and no additional assumptions were needed.

The range for the conditional NDC target has been updated from the previous assessment due to an update in historical emissions. We used the 2016 historical emissions value (incl. LULUCF) from Chile’s latest National Inventory Report (BUR5) to recalculate the new range (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2023).

For the new conditional target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions by 2030, compared to 2016 levels – we assumed that reductions from “net emissions” refers to economy-wide emissions incl. LULUCF. This translates into an emissions target of 25.1 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF) by 2030. Chile has not provided further details on the extent to which it will rely on LULUCF to meet the conditional target, thus we have developed a range based on the following assumptions:

- For the lower end of the range, we assumed that the further emissions reductions needed to meet the conditional target, as compared to the unconditional target, will come from reductions in all sectors except LULUCF. Thus, we assume the 45% reduction would apply to emissions excluding LULUCF. This translates into an 88 MtCO2e emissions level by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). For the same year, we assume the LULUCF sink would remain at -63.1 MtCO2e, its most recent historical value.
- For the upper end of the range, we assumed that the further emissions reductions needed to meet the conditional target as compared to the unconditional target will come entirely from removals in the LULUCF sector. This means emissions excluding LULUCF by 2030 will remain at 95 MtCO2e (as in the unconditional target), while the LULUCF sink increases to -69.9 MtCO2e.

## Current policy projections

Current policy projections have been harmonised to historical emissions up to 2022. We derive our current policy projections using a few different sources.

For the upper range of our current policy projections, we use:

- **Energy CO2 emissions:** based on the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2022 Outlook. As this scenario includes all current key policies, no additional calculations were added. These policies include Chile’s Energy Efficiency Law, the retirement of coal plants by 2040, with 65% of coal plant capacity shutting down before 2025, the National Electromobility Strategy, as well as its Hydrogen Strategy (APEC, 2022).
- **Energy non-CO2 emissions:** based on non-CO2 emissions projections from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).
- **Industrial processes, agriculture, and waste emissions:** based on Chile’s Fifth Biennial Update Report (BUR5) (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022).
For the lower range of our current policy projections, we use:

- **All sectors, including energy:** based on the ‘Transición tardía’ projections from Chile’s Fifth Biennial Report (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022).
For ‘other’ sector emissions in both scenarios, we have taken a 10-year historical trend (2010-2019) from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).

We also compared our current policy projections to those from Observatorio de Carbono Neutralidad (across all sectors) harmonised to 2022 emissions, but this currently falls between the lower and upper end of our CPP (Observatorio de Carbono Neutralidad, 2024).

Some policy developments such as the update on the Distributed Generation Law (also referred to as the “Net Billing” Law) (Law 20.571), which triples the capacity threshold for installed capacity for projects of self-consumption, are not quantified due to lack of available data.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Chile has committed to being net-zero by 2050. According to Chile’s long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC, the target includes a LULUCF sink of 65 MtCO2e to neutralise remaining emissions. Thus, we estimate Chile’s total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF in 2050 to be 65 MtCO2e (Gobierno de Chile, 2021).


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


## Black carbon

Black carbon can have both a warming and a cooling effect in the atmosphere, depending on where it is: black carbon on snow reduces the albedo of the surface and thus leads to warming. It also leads to higher local temperature of the snow and thus to higher rate of snow melt. Both cooling and warming effects can emerge from interferences with other particles in the atmosphere (depending on the exact conditions). The IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) indicates a net-positive effect of black carbon on warming over time, i.e. in sum, black carbon has contributed more to warming than cooling over the last centuries (Szopa et al., 2021). AR6 also reports an increase in the radiative forcing of black carbon over time, meaning that the warming effects are growing more strongly than the cooling effects.

The IPCC concludes that reducing emissions of black carbon (as well as other anthropogenic emissions like methane) in the short term would contribute to limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C. Along with the decarbonisation of the energy system that is required for 1.5°C, black carbon decreases in the 1.5°C compatible scenarios analysed in the IPCC's 6th Assessment Report.

The climate response of black carbon differs from greenhouse gases in terms of the geographical reach of its impacts, its lifetime, and its interactions with other particles and gases in the atmosphere. The IPCC therefore does not provide any estimate of the global warming potential of black carbon


# Targets


## Target Overview

Chile’s submitted its updated 2020 NDC to the UNFCCC in April 2020 (Government of Chile, 2020a). It includes two 2030 emissions reduction targets: an absolute unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e or a budget of 1,100 MtCO2e (2020–2030) and an emissions reduction target of up to 45% net GHG emissions conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. With the approval of the Climate Change Framework Law in June 2020, this target is legally binding.

Chile also announced a net zero GHG target for 2050 which was enshrined in law in June 2022 with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).


## NDC updates

On 9 April 2020, the Chilean government officially submitted its updated NDC (Government of Chile, 2020a), which is more ambitious than its first NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in 2017 and also slightly more ambitious than an earlier 2019 draft NDC. We rate both Chile’s conditional 2030 NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target against its fair-share contributions to be “Almost sufficient”. Chile needs to make some improvements to its targets if it aims to become compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5° limit.

According to our calculations, by implementing all its current policies, Chile has already peaked its emissions ahead of the proposed peak year of 2025 ─ which would be a remarkable achievement and makes the country a frontrunner in climate action. Under this scenario, the GHG emissions budget between 2020 and 2030 would be in line with the GHG emissions budget of 1,100 presented in the 2020 NDC, according to our calculations.

The updated NDC is stronger in various ways:

- It has a target of 95 MtCO2e in 2030, which is 2 MtCO2e lower than the 2019 draft NDC and significantly lower than the emissions that would have resulted from the 2017 unconditional target (131 MtCO2e);
- It includes an updated goal to peak GHG emissions by 2025, two years earlier than the previous draft;
- It includes an updated GHG emissions budget to 2030, which is smaller than the original draft.
Both the unconditional and conditional NDCs include the following three targets for the LULUCF sector:

- Sustainable management and recovery of 200,000 hectares of native forest, equivalent to GHG emissions capture between 0.9 and 1.2 MtCO2e/year by 2030;
- Reforestation of 200,000 hectares of forest, from which at least half correspond to permanent forest coverage, from which at least 70,000 hectares should be native species. This is equivalent to GHG emissions capture of 3–3.4 MtCO2e/year by 2030;
- Reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation of native forest by 25% by 2030 compared to average emissions between 2001–2013.
- 16.10.2019 “Chile submitted a draft NDC update in 2019”
- 09.04.2020 “Chile submitted an NDC update”

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("modelled domestic pathways"). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with their share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Chile has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources, and one that is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions and may require international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target, which Chile refers to as its ‘internationally supported’ target, against the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways.** This rating indicates that Chile’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could increase the ambition of its conditional 2030 climate target equivalent to an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it.

While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals.

The 2020 NDC links the 2030 target to the long-term goal for GHG neutrality by 2050, as well as to planning processes involving governance and existing and future strategies, including the “Long-term Climate Strategy 2050.” According to the NDC text, the current NDC planning and update process should allow for the NDC and its consecutive iterations to be intermediate milestones to achieve the 2050 neutrality goal, i.e. taking into account the necessary measures to reach the goal (Government of Chile, 2020a).

It also includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030 below 2016 emission levels.

**Black Carbon and Chile’s NDC**

Chile’s 2020 NDC update includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions, which has substantial co-benefits for human health. However, reductions in black carbon are generally not additional to reductions in CO2, because large fractions of black carbon emissions stem from the same emission sources as CO2. Emission reduction policies therefore often reduce CO2 and black carbon simultaneously, and this is already included in calculations of the emissions reductions required to hold warming well below 2°C globally, like the “emissions gap” and “fair share” reductions (see section on Fair Share).

In its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC does not provide calculations of Global Warming Potential for black carbon comparable to those provided for greenhouse gases. The report indicates a net-positive effect on warming of black carbon over time and concludes that reducing black carbon emissions in the short-term would contribute to limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C.

For information on Chile’s 2019 draft NDC or its original submission in 2017, see our comparison assessment of Chile’s NDCs and the previous country assessment of the 2017 NDC submission.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

**We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Almost sufficient ” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action**. The “Almost sufficient ” rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Chile’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The unconditional NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient”. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition, compared to our previous assessment.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable.**

Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, the target was also included in the LTS and, since June 2022, it is enshrined in law with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).

Chile’s net zero target covers most key elements. It covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses and budgets. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits.

Chile could further improve its net zero target by considering good practice standards for a few elements. It could include international aviation and shipping in its target’s scope, and explicitly elaborate on fairness considerations.

# Summary


## Overview

**Chile has made considerable progress on climate action over the past few years following the enactment of the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2022. This is reflected in the rapid rate of renewables expansion and the coal phase-out plan going faster than anticipated.** **With this update, the CAT’s overall rating of Chile’s climate targets and actions has improved to “Almost sufficient”, one of the few countries to earn this rating.**

**The impact of Chile’s coal phase-out could be lessened, however, if it results in higher natural gas consumption from planned reconversions. Eight coal-fired units have yet to make a retirement commitment: they are not obliged to stop operating until 2040. The implementation of measures in the energy end-use and other sectors, transport in particular, has also been occurring at a slower pace than what is needed to meet Chile’s commitments under its climate target (NDC) and related policy documents.**

According to our estimates, Chile's emissions have already peaked, in 2021, ahead of its 2025 commitment in the NDC. However, Chile will not be able to meet its 2030 NDC target under current policies. Chile’s upper end of its current policy projections also sits in the “Insufficient” range, meaning a lack of implementation of mitigation policies and increased natural gas consumption from retrofitting coal plants could result in a worse rating for Chile.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has finalised its National Mining Policy 2050, which includes a target for the industry sector to reach carbon neutrality by 2040, in addition to zero fleet and renewable electricity objectives. New laws to promote renewable energy and address critical barriers like the lack of transmission lines, such as the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility and the Energy Transition Law have been in the legislative process for a couple of years now.

Chile has also published new sectoral strategies to guide its short-term climate plans such as the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan, the Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, as well as the Green Hydrogen Action Plan 2023–2030. Chile has outlined its short-term measures for promoting its green hydrogen industry and becoming a top exporter by 2040 and is in the process of piloting its domestically produced hydrogen bus by early next year.

Chile’s coal phase-out is well on track, with some units retiring faster than expected. More than 1.2 GW of coal capacity from 11 plants has been retired since 2019. Another nine plants have made commitments to retire or convert to natural gas by the end of 2025. This is in line with the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan target to retire or reconvert 70% of coal-fired units by the end of 2025, representing 3.6 GW in capacity. Gas must still be phased out in the short-term, however, and Chile should be careful when repurposing plants to avoid carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C.

To accelerate its emission reductions to be aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, Chile could:

- **Revive discussions on shifting the national coal phase-out date from 2040 to 2030** to mandate the remaining eight coal-fired plants that have not made firm retirement commitments to have a more ambitious retirement date.
- **Decrease economic incentives for fossil fuels.** Chile’s carbon tax is considered relatively ineffective due to its low carbon price, while diesel fuel is still subsidised for internal combustion engines (ICE).
- **Implement concrete mitigation measures in the energy end-use, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors** so that they can also contribute to emissions reductions leading up to 2030.
- **Rapidly increase the pace of reforestation and sustainable forest management** for Chile to meet its LULUCF commitments under its NDC and maintain the sector’s crucial status as a considerable sink. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on increasing its LULUCF sink to meets its climate targets, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance, and should instead prioritise emissions reductions in all other sectors.
Since our previous assessment, the positive developments in Chile’s climate policies include:

- Accelerating the pace of the coal phase-out since its initial announcement in 2019, with the Ministry of Energy announcing its intentions for 70% of coal plants to be retired or retrofitted by 2025.
- The Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, which aims to address the infrastructure gaps that are hindering EV uptake.
- Chile has put a large focus on the just transition of the coal phase-out to promote job creation, new investments, and participatory planning in affected communities, including in the Ministry of Energy’s recent Decarbonisation Plan.
- Explicitly including a link between biodiversity and climate mitigation in its NDC.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

**The CAT rates Chile’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient”.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and commitments are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements.

Chile is almost meeting its “fair share” contributions to climate change mitigation. Chile’s unconditional NDC is rated as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair share. Chile’s conditional NDC and policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, Chile could strengthen its climate policies and set slightly more ambitious conditional and unconditional NDC targets.

**Chile’s current policies are "Almost sufficient" when rated against modelled domestic pathways.** This rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

According to our assessment, emissions under Chile’s currently implemented policies would reach between 100–108 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels, when emissions peaked). This emissions level is also insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO2e). Chile needs to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5° compatible.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has continued to shut down coal plants according to its phase-out plan. Over 1.2 GW of coal capacity from eleven plants has been retired since 2019 and an additional nine units have committed to retire or convert to natural gas between 2024 and 2025. Up to five of these units are expected to be retrofitted for gas.

While considered a “transition fuel” by the Chilean government, fossil gas is still a fossil fuel that the CAT estimates needs to be completely phased out by 2035 to remain on a global 1.5°C pathway. Therefore, Chile must be careful when repurposing its coal-fired plants to gas, as this could create either a carbon lock-in - or a risk of being left with stranded assets.

While there were discussions around bringing forward the coal phase-out year to 2030, it has not been mentioned for some time and recent policy documents reference the 2040 phase-out date. An early coal phase-out, where electricity generation is replaced by renewable sources rather than fossil gas, would significantly impact Chile’s current policies pathway and bring it considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory and be aligned with CAT’s power sector benchmarks.

The transport sector makes up a significant share of Chile’s total GHG emissions, especially as its energy consumption continues to increase. The Electromobility Strategy, Energy Efficiency Law, and ban on ICE cars by 2035 are key policies expected to accelerate the low-carbon transportation transition, but Chile’s EV sales have yet to exceed 1%. More should be done to encourage EV uptake and decrease energy demand in the sector, for instance, by reforming diesel fuel subsidies and a modal shift in transportation, so that Chile does not fall behind on its transport electrification targets.

Maintaining the LULUCF sink is an important component of Chile’s climate targets which is threatened by the increased frequency and severity of wildfires related to climate change. While Chile has ambitious commitments for reforestation and sustainable forest management in its NDC, the pace of implementation has been far too slow, and stronger policies to support reforestation and forest management are needed.

**We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions from 2016 values by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways**. This rating indicates that Chile’s internationally supported target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals.

To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could improve its 2030 target from 45% to roughly 67% to reach an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it.

**We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target – the absolute emissions target of 95 MtCO****2****e excluding LULUCF in 2030 – as “Almost sufficient” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action.** This rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient” from our previous update. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore excludes studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition compared to our previous assessment.

Chile has large forested areas, and although emissions have fluctuated strongly, e.g. because major wildfires swept across the country in 2017, Chile’s LULUCF sinks over the last 20 years absorbed, on average, roughly two-thirds of total emissions. Chile should work toward maintaining this LULUCF sink, but it is far from meeting its ambitious reforestation and sustainable forest management commitments in its NDC. For more information about forestry activities in Chile, please see the LULUCF tab under Policies and Actions.

**We evaluate Chile’s net zero target** as** “Acceptable”.** Chile’s currently proposed net zero target for 2050 covers most key elements and is now also Legally Binding through the Framework Law. Chile’s target covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses.

Chile plans to heavily rely on negative emissions by forests to reach its net zero target, expecting carbon sinks to contribute as much as 50% of the emissions reduction required to reach the 2050 neutrality goal (Gobierno de Chile, 2021).

It is therefore extremely important to assure that forests keep acting as sinks and do not turn into emission sources, a risk that can only partly be mitigated by policies, as not only human activity but natural factors, and increasingly the effects of climate change via more extreme and frequent heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, can turn removals from LULUCF to emissions. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits to make this clearer.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

**We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable.**

Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, Chile included this target in the LTS and it was enshrined in law in June 2022 with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).

Chile’s net zero target covers most key elements. It covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses and budgets. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits.

Chile could further improve its net zero target by considering good practice standards for a few elements. It could include international aviation and shipping in its target’s scope, and explicitly elaborate on fairness considerations.

## CAT analysis of net zero target

**Scope**

- **Target year** – Chile aims to reach net zero by 2050 (President of Chile, 2020).
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers) (President of Chile, 2020).
- **International aviation and shipping** – Chile provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions or removals outside its borders. Neither Chile’s NDC nor its underlying pathways towards 2050 explicitly rule out international credits (Government of Chile, 2020a; Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – Chile passed its net zero target in the Climate Change Framework Law (Ley Marco de Cambio Climatico, 21455) on 13 June 2022 (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Chile specifies separate emissions reductions and removal targets by specifying the contribution of LULUCF in 2030 and 2050. (Government of Chile, 2020b; Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Review process** – Chile has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target (long-term strategy) and sectoral plans.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Chile provides transparent pathways for carbon dioxide removal from domestic LULUCF sinks through 2050 and assumes no technical carbon removals and storage in the timeframe up to 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – Chile provides intermediate carbon budgets as well as sector specific targets in their NDC. The NDC provides several carbon neutrality scenarios per sector and highlights the necessary measures, such as reaching a 58% share of electric vehicles among private and commercial vehicles by 2050, replacing thermal power stations with renewable energy systems, and installing electric heating in public and commercial buildings. The strategy also establishes an emissions peak no later than 2025 and sets a maximum budget for cumulative emissions from 2020–2030 (Government of Chile, 2020b). The NDC further defines clear visions for 2030 and 2050 and Chile provides detailed pathway analyses (Ministerio de Energía, 2020b).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Chile makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target in the climate change framework law nor in the long-term strategy.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

**Chile has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been officially submitted to the UNFCCC, we will publish our full assessment here.**


# Policies & action

**Chile’s current policies are almost sufficient when rated against modelled domestic pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Chile’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

Chile’s upper end of its current policy projections sits in the “Insufficient” range, meaning a lack of implementation of mitigation policies and increased natural gas consumption from retrofitting coal plants could result in a worse rating for Chile. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

According to our assessment, emissions under Chile’s currently implemented policies would reach 100–108 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) by 2030 (6–13% below 2021 levels). The CAT estimates that Chile reached peak emissions in 2021, ahead of the 2025 target in its NDC. However, this emissions level is still insufficient to reach both the conditional and unconditional 2030 NDC targets (88–95 MtCO2e), let alone be on a 1.5°C trajectory. Chile will need to implement additional policies in order to be 1.5°C compatible.

Since our previous assessment, Chile has continued to shut down coal plants according to its phase-out plan. Over 1.2 GW of coal capacity from 11 plants has been retired since 2019 and an additional nine units have committed to retire or convert to natural gas between 2024 and 2025. While considered a “transition fuel” by the Chilean government, gas is still a fossil fuel that needs to be phased out – therefore, Chile must be careful when repurposing the plants to avoid the risk of carbon lock-in and stranded assets. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).

While there were discussions in August 2022 around bringing forward the coal phase-out year to 2030, it has not been mentioned in the Second Phase of the Energy Transition strategy released in 2023 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022a). An early coal phase-out, where electricity generation is replaced by renewable sources rather than fossil gas, could significantly impact Chile’s current policies pathway and bring it considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory.

The transport sector makes up a significant share of Chile’s total GHG emissions, especially as its energy consumption continues to increase. The Electromobility Strategy, Energy Efficiency Law, and ban on ICE cars by 2035 are key policies expected to accelerate the low-carbon transportation transition, but Chile’s EV sales have yet to exceed 1%. More could be done to encourage EV uptake and decrease energy demand, for instance, by reforming diesel fuel subsidies and a incentivising a modal shift in transportation.

Maintaining the LULUCF sink is an important component of Chile’s climate targets, which is threatened by the increased frequency and severity of wildfires related to climate change. While Chile has ambitious commitments for reforestation and sustainable forest management in its NDC, the pace of implementation has been far too slow, and stronger policies to support reforestation and forest management are needed. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks for its targets and prioritise cutting emissions in other sectors.

## Policy overview

Between 2010 and 2022, Chile’s emissions increased by 27%, from 88 MtCO2e to 112 MtCO2e, excluding LULUCF. When considering Chile’s current policies, we estimate that Chile’s emissions already peaked in 2021 at a level of 115 MtCO2e. According to our assessment, Chile’s emissions levels in 2030 under current policies will be between 100–108 MtCO2e/year (excl. LULUCF). Our analysis suggests that Chile will not meet its conditional nor unconditional NDC targets in 2030 under current policies, or be 1.5° compatible.

Compared to our previous assessment, emissions under current policies have increased due to higher historical emissions than previously projected, a stronger rebound after COVID, and changes to the current policy assumptions.

Chile’s key climate policies include the Energy Efficiency Law (Law 21.305/2021), a legal framework aiming to reduce energy consumption across the power, transport, buildings, and industry sectors. It also includes the coal phase-out, where all of Chile’s coal-fired units (28) are expected to retire or be retrofitted by 2040. An earlier coal phase-out could have a sizable impact on Chile’s current policy trajectory, but only if the coal capacity is replaced with generation from renewable energy sources. The CAT estimates that choosing to retrofit coal plants with gas could lead to at least 3 MtCO2e fewer in emission reductions in the short-term compared to retiring coal-fired units and using renewable electricity sources, and can lead to carbon lock-in risks and stranded assets.

The Electromobility Strategy guides climate policy in the transport sector and sets out an action plan to electrify 100% of the urban public transport vehicle fleet by 2050 and ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines in 2035. Chile has also introduced a carbon tax (Law 20.780/2014), although its price is likely too low to result in emissions reductions.

In June 2022, Chile passed the Framework Law on Climate Change (21455) (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022). It includes the 2050 GHG neutrality target and recognises the NDC target, making them legally binding. As a result, Chile now has a legal framework that assigns responsibilities and strengthens the legal and institutional basis for implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation policies across all sectors, and is moving towards a low emissions economy. It also presents a paradigm shift in Chile’s environmental policy, as climate action is now not only the responsibility of the environment ministry but is spread across 17 national ministries, as well as regional governments and municipalities, and even includes the private sector.

While most of the important regulations outlined in the Framework Law on Climate Change have come into force, Chile has been delayed in implementing two new regulations and modifying two existing regulations (Peña, 2024). The regulation on its Article 6 framework is heading into its consultation stage, but there has been no movement on its related law outlining the requirements and verification method around the GHG emissions reduction or absorption certificates. The law also mandates the relevant ministries to develop sectoral mitigation plans by 2024, but no plans have yet been released (CR2 and Centro de Derecho Ambiental, 2024).

Since our previous assessment, there have been no major changes to Chile’s climate policies. New laws to promote renewable energy and address critical barriers like a lack of transmission lines, such as the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility and the Energy Transition Law, have been in the legislative process for a couple of years now.

Chile has nevertheless made progress in that time, publishing new sectoral strategies to guide its short-term climate plans such as the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Energy’s Decarbonisation Plan, the Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility, as well as the Green Hydrogen Action Plan 2023-2030.

Chile is on track with its 2040 coal phase-out plan, meeting its goal of retiring 11 plants by 2024, and has even accelerated its implementation. Nine of the remaining coal-fired units have currently committed to being retired or retrofitted between 2024 and 2025, although it is unclear whether the retirement or reconversion will be timely. However, the eight remaining coal plants have yet to make a firm commitment: it is still possible for them to continue operating until 2040. While there were some discussions in 2022 on adopting an even earlier, more ambitious phase-out date of 2030, this has not been mentioned in a while. To bring its current policies considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory, Chile could update its national commitment to phase out coal-fired power by 2030.


## Power sector

The power sector is Chile's largest emitting sector, accounting for 27% of total GHG emissions, or 39% of energy sector emissions. The general share of electricity production sources in 2023 was around 29% hydropower, 20% solar, 17% coal, 18.5% fossil gas, 11% wind power, 4% other fossil fuels, and 0.5% of other renewables (Ember, 2024). Fossil fuels have made up two-thirds to a half of electricity generation since 2000, with hydropower accounting for the remaining share up to 2014. Since 2021, hydropower generation has notably dropped, which can be attributed to both drought conditions and the uptake of other renewable sources (i.e. wind and solar) (Revista Energética de Chile, 2022).

Chile has several key strategies and policies guiding its energy planning. The updated Energy Strategy, titled Chile’s Energy Transition (also known as PEN for Política Energética Nacional), was published in March 2022, and replaces the previous 2050 Energy Strategy from 2017. It sets a long-term vision for energy planning and provides a roadmap including 66 targets covering various sectors.

Targets have become substantially more ambitious than in the previous iteration: the targeted renewables share in electricity generation has increased from 60% by 2035 to 80% by 2030 and from 70% to 100% by 2050, setting out the new goal of a 100% renewable power system for the first time (Ministerio de Energía, 2015, 2022c). According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, Chile should achieve a more ambitious renewables share between 96–98% in 2030 and decarbonise by 2035 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

A follow-up roadmap to the Energy Route 2018–2022, the other key ministerial document, known as PELP 2023–2027 (Planificación Energética de Largo Plazo) was released last year. It includes three modelled pathways, one based on current policies that assumes the 2030 NDC target will be reached, and two more ambitious pathways aiming at GHG neutrality by 2050 and earlier.

The Energy Efficiency Law (Ley de Eficiencia Energética, Law No. 21.305) was officially established as a legal framework for energy efficiency in February 2021. The law aims to foster energy efficiency and covers the industry, mining, transport, and buildings sectors, thereby reducing total final energy consumption by 10% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 in addition to various sectoral-level targets. It will play a central role in reaching net zero emissions in 2050 and also in achieving mid-term targets, and claims to lead to a reduction of 28.6 MtCO2e by 2030 (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d).

Chile has also implemented a carbon tax of 5 USD/tCO2 for stationary sources (turbines or boilers above 50 MWth­), which came into effect in 2017. Payments for 2017 began in April 2018 and accounted for more than USD 190m (El Mercurio, 2018). In 2021, the tax covered 32.5% of GHG emissions. As of 2022, Chile’s carbon tax is applicable to all ‘large emitters’ (>25 ktCO2e/year) without any sectoral exclusions (OECD, 2024). However, Chile’s carbon tax is considered to be relatively ineffective due to its low prices.

Both the current policy and 2050 Energy Strategy scenarios from the Mitigation Plan include considerable generation from hydro — which accounted for 28.5% of generation in 2023 (Ember, 2024). The construction of large hydropower projects in Chile is highly controversial, largely because of significant adverse environmental and social impacts. In 2014, Chile’s government overturned environmental permits for HidroAysén, a massive hydroelectric project in Patagonia, after a seven year campaign against it - the largest environmental campaign in Chile’s history (NRDC, 2016).


### Coal

In June 2019, Chile announced its plans to completely phase out coal by 2040 and aim for GHG neutrality by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2019). In line with this announcement, Chile signed the coal exit agreement and all of its clauses at COP26 and also prominently disclosed it in its updated NDC.

Since then, the coal phase-out has been progressing considerably faster than anticipated. The number of power plants to be shut by 2024 was increased to 11 in a 2020 updated plan (Ministerio de Energía, 2020c). In January 2024, the Ministry of Energy presented its Decarbonisation Plan, including a goal to retire or retrofit (with gas) 70%, or about 20, of Chile’s coal plants by the end of 2025 (Ministerio de Energía, 2023c).

The accelerated coal phase-out plan, while a very positive development, would mean Chile’s remaining coal-fired units are those without any concrete retirement commitments. At the moment, they are not obligated to stop operating until 2040, meaning that Chile could still use coal to meet its electricity demands until then. According to the CAT, an earlier coal phase-out date would align Chile with a 1.5°C global pathway (see graph). An early coal phase-out would also help bring Chile’s policies considerably closer to a 1.5°C trajectory if coal plants are completely retired in place of retrofitting them into natural gas plants (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

As of July 2024, Chile has successfully retired 11 power plants with around 1.2 GW of installed capacity, achieving the 2024 goal. In 2023, only one coal-fired unit from the Ventanas power plant was retired, while in April 2024, the Norgener 1 and Norgener 2 units (totaling 276 MW) in Tocopilla were disconnected much earlier than their scheduled December 2025 date (Global Energy Monitor, 2024; Pizzoleo, 2024). After the approval of the Norgener plants’ retirement, however, the energy provider requested to continue operating in order to burn its remaining coal stock (Muñoz, 2024).

The first part of Chile’s Just Transition Strategy puts a focus on the retirement of coal plants. It aims to promote new job opportunities and investments, avoid significant increases in electricity rates, and develop new industries in communities that would be affected by the closure of coal plants. The strategy emphasises a participatory process with affected stakeholders and its implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Committee (Ministerio de Energía, 2021a).

Nine of the remaining coal-fired units have made commitments to retire or reconvert between 2024 and 2025 (Ministerio de Energía, 2023c). However, the owners of the eight remaining units, representing 1.9 GW of coal capacity, have yet to make a firm commitment, so it is still possible for them to continue operating until the 2040 national commitment date (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

In August 2022, when the energy minister presented the new Energy Agenda 2022, he mentioned that discussions were ongoing for an even more ambitious plan to retire all coal power plants by 2030 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022a), but these plans have not been mentioned in a while. In April 2023, the Ministry of Energy launched the Initial Agenda for the Second Phase of the Energy Transition, where only the 2040 coal phase-out was referenced. An early coal phase-out would help bring Chile’s policies on track to being 1.5° compatible. According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, a 2030 phase-out would also align Chile with the global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Although some plants were shut down six to 12 months after the planned date, Chile’s coal phase-out plan has gone beyond its initial expectations. Chile should, however, be careful when retrofitting its coal power plants with gas. Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).


### Fossil gas and oil

Fossil gas has made up 15–20% of Chile’s electricity generation over the past 10 years (Ember, 2024). Chile produces less than 20% of its total gas supply, and primarily relies on imports, but expects to increase its fossil gas production in the coming years. For instance, in February 2024, a Chilean energy company signed a deal with a California-based gas technology company to boost production by up to 200% (Geiger, 2024). There is no room for new investments in fossil fuel activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C (Green et al., 2024).

Chile’s coal phase-out allows for power plants to convert to fossil gas power generation in place of complete retirement (Deza, 2024). Fossil gas should only play a minor role in Paris Agreement-compatible pathways: according to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, fossil gas should only make up 1–4% of Chile’s electricity generation in 2030 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). This also raises questions around energy security, seeing as Chile continues to import most of its fossil gas.


### Renewables

Hydropower has historically accounted for a considerable share of Chile’s electricity production, accounting for almost 50% of electricity generated in 2000, but its share has decreased to 28.5% in 2023 and has been replaced by the rapid deployment of wind and solar (Ember, 2024). While wind and solar power made up less than 0.1% of electricity generation in 2013, their shares have significantly increased to 11% and 20% of total electricity production, respectively, in the past ten years.

Chile has set out a target of achieving an 80% share of renewable electricity generation by 2030 and 100% by 2050. According to the CAT’s power sector benchmarks, Chile should achieve a more ambitious renewables share between 96–98% in 2030 and decarbonise by 2035 to be aligned with a global 1.5°C pathway (see graph) (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Various laws to foster renewable energy growth have been passed or are in the legislative process. The Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility (Law 21.505), published in 2022, will enable storage systems that are separate from generation facilities to be paid for providing energy to the grid, especially in times in high demand. One of the main objectives of this law is to reduce the reliance on coal by improving the energy security of the electricity system (Ministerio de Energía, 2022b).

The Energy Transition Law is a legislative initiative that will serve as an intermediary step for the structural reforms needed to achieve Chile’s carbon neutrality goal. Its three main pillars are promoting the efficient development of transmission projects, enabling the buildout of key infrastructure, and encouraging the competitive advancement of energy storage. The Bill Promoting Renewable Energies in the Electricity Matrix aims to establish renewable energy quotas for new electricity contracts, gradually increasing until reaching 60% in 2030 (Medinilla, 2023).

As a measure to foster decentralised renewable energy deployment, in early 2018, Chile reformed its Distributed Generation Law (also referred to as the “Net Billing” Law) (Law 20.571). The reform included a tripling of installed capacity from 100 kW to 300 kW, which aims to support and promote larger projects of self-consumption of electricity (Ministerio de Energía, 2018). Electricity surplus can be fed into the grid to obtain discounts in the owner’s electricity bill. The reform establishes, that if an owner has more than one establishment, these discounts are also applicable for those electricity bills. Otherwise, discounts from surplus can be accumulated.


### Green hydrogen

Chile’s National Green Hydrogen Strategy, published in late 2020, set goals for Chile to produce the lowest-cost green hydrogen by 2030 and become a top three global exporter by 2040 (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a). Hydrogen plays a significant role in Chile’s carbon neutrality strategy, and is expected to contribute a quarter of the necessary emissions reductions in 2050 (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).

The strategy emphasises green hydrogen’s role in the decarbonisation of the transport, mining, and agriculture sectors. One of its first objectives is to use green hydrogen in heavy and long-distance transportation, and later to also replace liquid fuels in land transportation and aviation. Green hydrogen and its derivatives are also expected to be incorporated in the industry sector and produce green ammonia for low-carbon fertiliser production (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a).

To operationalise the Hydrogen Strategy, Chile published its Green Hydrogen Action Plan in April 2024, which outlines short-term measures to promote green hydrogen production and utilisation (Gobierno de Chile, 2024). A significant number of actions are focused around developing the enabling infrastructure for the green hydrogen industry and its regulatory and financial support. In the transport sector, a public-private partnership is in the process of developing Chile’s first locally-made hydrogen bus, which is expected to be piloted by the first half of 2025 (Gobierno de Chile, 2023c). The plan also explores converting thermal plants to run on hydrogen or hydrogen-based fuels through co-combustion or blending (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).


## Industry

Chile is the world’s leading copper exporter, and the mining and industry sector is Chile’s largest consumer of final energy, accounting for 36% of energy consumption in 2021 and approximately 17% of total GHG emissions (IEA, 2024a). In 2021, 44% of mining electricity consumption came from renewable sources, and it is estimated that it will reach 62% in 2025.

Chile has established several targets to minimise emissions from the mining and industry sector in its energy strategy (PEN). They include:

- an emissions reduction target of 70% of direct GHG emissions from fuel use in the industry and mining sector by 2050 below 2018 levels,
- an improvement of energy intensity of large energy consumers by at least 25% in 2050 below 2021,
- a requirement that at least 90% of energy for heating and cooling in industry must come from sustainable sources by 2050,
- a goal of 100,000 new energy jobs by 2030, direct and indirect, from sustainable energy projects in new energy-related industries, and
- a requirement that 100% of medium and large companies in Chile must implement effective and monitorable energy efficiency and/or renewable energy measures.
These measures are also featured in Chile’s LTS (Gobierno de Chile, 2021; Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).

Mining companies themselves play an important role in meeting these targets. The Chilean Copper Commission (COCHILCO) has carried out surveys and compiled data on GHG emissions and energy consumption, the Green Mining Roundtable was launched in 2019, and the Chilean Economic Development Agency (CORFO) has supported the deployment of hydrogen vehicles for mining (Ministerio de Energía, 2020a). The deployment of green hydrogen and its derivatives in the mining sector is a key component of Chile’s Green Hydrogen Strategy and Action Plan (Gobierno de Chile, 2024).

The National Mining Policy 2050, developed by the Ministry of Mining, was approved in early 2023, and includes several objectives related to GHG emissions and environmental considerations. Notably, it includes a target to reduce emissions from large mining operations by at least 50% by 2030, and to become a carbon-neutral industry by 2040. It also outlines a zero-emissions fleet plan to be released by 2025 and implemented by 2030, as well as an objective for 90% of electricity contracts to come from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2050 (Gobierno de Chile, 2023a). Along with being responsible for the monitoring and implementation of the above, the Ministry of Mining is also directed to establish GHG emissions targets for scope 1, 2, and 3 that comply with the 2030 target.

Among the provisions of the new Energy Efficiency Law approved in early 2021 is the promotion of energy management in the country's largest consumers. These include all large companies with consumption over 50 Tcal per year (210 TJ/yr), cumulatively accounting for more than one third of the country’s consumed energy. These so-called consumers with energy management capacity have to implement an energy management system that covers at least 80% of their emissions and will additionally have to prepare an annual public report on several performance indicators, including energy consumption and energy intensity (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d; Ministerio de Hacienda: Oficina de Partes, 2021)


## Transport

The transport sector accounted for a third of Chile’s total final energy consumption (34%) in 2021, almost the same as the industry sector, as well as a third (33%) of its total GHG emissions, considering 99% of the sector’s energy consumption is from imported fossil fuels (IEA, 2023).

As with other sectors, Chile has established a number of targets to minimise emissions from the transport sector in its energy strategy (PEN). The most prominent target is that 100% of new light- and medium-duty vehicles sales must be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. In line with this target, at COP26 Chile signed the declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% EVs. However, Chile is not on progress to meet this target: its EV sales have yet to exceed 1% as of 2024. For Chile to achieve its transport electrification ambitions, it needs additional policies to support EV uptake.

In December 2017, Chile published its Electromobility Strategy, which sets out a goal and action plan towards achieving a 40% share of electric passenger vehicles as well as a 100% electrified public transport fleet by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2017a). Chile’s Energy Strategy (PEN, or Política Energética Nacional), published in 2022, updated these targets and made them more ambitious, aiming for 100% zero emission vehicles in public transport and urban public transport by 2040, and 60% of private and commercial vehicles to be zero emissions by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).

Other transport goals include a 40% reduction in direct GHG emissions from the use of fuels in the sector (including land, sea, and air transport) by 2050 compared to 2018 (20% by 2040). Chile’s Energy Route 2018–2022 set out a short-term goal of a 10-fold increase in EVs in 2022 (compared to 2017 levels). While this was overachieved by more than double, the target was relative to a very low initial EV stock in 2017 at only 231 cars (Ministerio de Energía, 2021e; IEA, 2024b).

Chile is already beginning to implement actions towards achieving these targets. As of April 2024, Chile has reportedly reached over 2,500 electric buses in its public transport system, representing 38% of its total fleet (Carrara, 2024). Electric buses now represent around one-fifth of total bus sales in the country (IEA, 2024c). At the same time, the market share of EVs remains low, and decreased in past year from 0.5% to 0.3% of vehicles sold in 2023, and EVs make up only 0.1% of the total car fleet. EV sales have more than doubled, however, compared to 2019 and increased five-fold in the past six years, indicating a rapid upward trend. Public charging infrastructure is rather limited, with only 1,070 units (up from 660 in 2022) units in 2023 (compared to e.g., 51,000 in Germany) (IEA, 2024b).

In addition to promoting renewables in the energy matrix, the Law on Energy Storage and Electromobility (21.505) includes measures to encourage EV uptake. The law includes temporary exemptions or reductions for driving permit fees for electric and hybrid vehicles, thus matching those of ICE vehicles, and enables battery EVs to connect to the grid and store energy (Ministerio de Energía, 2022b).

Building on the Electromobility Strategy, in 2023, Chile presented its Roadmap for the Advancement of Electromobility. This plan contains concrete measures to 2026 aimed at accelerating the EV transition and addressing Chile’s current EV infrastructure gap. Its main pillars are building a robust public infrastructure charging network, promoting public transportation and decentralisation in priority regions, and improving EV education and road safety (Gobierno de Chile, 2023b).

The Energy Efficiency Law also targets the transport sector. It establishes energy efficiency standards for imported vehicles, which came into effect this year, and government subsidies are offered for electric taxis and home charging points. It aims to ensure interoperability of the EV charging system, facilitates access and connection to the charging network, and allows the Ministry of Transport to establish energy efficiency standards for vehicles (Ministerio de Energía, 2021c).

Building on its Green Hydrogen Strategy, the government has also presented its Sustainable Aviation Fuels 2050 Roadmap (SAF 2050). The roadmap sets out a goal of achieving 50% of SAF use in aviation by 2050 by promoting local, decentralised production of new energy sources. including biofuels and green hydrogen (Ministerio de Energía, 2024).

Chile’s electromobility targets, initial implemented measures, and the 2035 ban of non-EV sales are a great step in the right direction, especially since they are integrated into new strategies and laws such as the Energy Efficiency Law and Green Hydrogen Strategy. However, additional policies, especially targeting private car ownership, are needed to meet both these targets and global decarbonisation benchmarks, which foresee having only zero emission cars on the road by 2050 to be compatible with limiting temperature to 1.5°C (Climate Action Tracker, 2016). For the development of an integral policy making framework for transport, it is of great importance to consider social and economic consequences of the different policy options. The total emissions reduction potential of transport electrification also significantly depends on the decarbonisation of the electricity supply used to charge vehicles.


## Buildings

Buildings consumed almost a quarter of the country's total energy in 2021, with a significant share of this used for heating, and were responsible for approximately 7% of Chile’s total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) in the same year (Comisión Nacional de Energía, 2021; Ministerio de Energía, 2022c; IEA, 2024a). It is therefore not surprising that the buildings sector is a central part of the Chile’s cross-sectoral Energy Efficiency Law.

The law establishes that residential buildings, public buildings, commercial buildings, and office buildings must have an energy rating to be commercialised (i.e. put on the market): this is applicable to construction and real estate companies as well as housing and urban planning services. As with appliances such as refrigerators, the energy efficiency label allows people to have better information when renting or buying homes. The label must be included in all sales advertising by companies (Ministerio de Energía, 2021d). This provision builds upon the existing Calificación Energética de Viviendas (CEV), established in 2011, and is also integrated into voluntary national building sustainability certifications (Ministerio de Energía, 2021b).

The Energy Efficiency Law also states that companies with high energy consumption (over 50 tcal) must annually report their energy consumption and energy intensity. It also introduces an Energy Management System (EMS), covering at least 80% of total energy consumption that includes an energy efficiency action plan, goals, and performance indicators. In 2023, the list of companies that must apply these regulations was published (Ministerio de Energía, 2023b).

As with other sectors, Chile’s energy strategy (PEN) also established a number of targets to minimise emissions from the buildings sector, including:

- a requirement that 10% of existing homes have a specific standard for thermal regulation by 2050, which should point towards net zero energy buildings;
- that 100% of new public buildings are "zero net energy consuming" by 2030, considering optimal energy performance of heating, hot water, cooling and lighting systems;
- that 100% of new residential and non-residential buildings are “zero net energy consumption” by 2050 (Ministerio de Energía, 2022c).
Even prior to the updated PEN and the Energy Efficiency Law, Chile has been pursuing strategies for the buildings sector such as the National Strategy for Sustainable Construction (ENCS), its main objectives being to incorporate sustainability criteria into buildings and infrastructure, reduce the sector’s energy consumption, reduce GHG emissions, and promote renewable energy use in construction (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo, 2013). In addition to being revalidated, the ENCS is currently in the process of being updated to respond to new national and international commitments, and better account for the impacts of climate change (Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo, 2024).

Chile has also implemented different financial incentives and support programmes to improve building energy efficiency. For instance, under Law no. 20.571/2016, Chile aims to incentivise the use of solar heating through tax cuts for developers who implement this technology (Ministerio de Energía, 2017b). In 2023, the energy and housing ministries introduced subsidies for families to implement solar heating, photovoltaic systems, thermal insulation, and to replace wood-burning heaters (Ministerio de Energía, 2023a).


## Methane

Chile signed the methane pledge at COP26. Chile’s methane emissions have remained relatively stable in recent decades, accounting for 15 MtCO2e in 2022 or 14% of total emissions (down from 24% in 1990) (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023). The agriculture (38%) and waste (51%) sectors account for most of Chile’s methane emissions, with a smaller share coming from the energy sector (11%).

A 30% cut in methane emissions would therefore translate into roughly 4 MtCO2e or 4% of total emissions, which would further increase Chile’s chances of meeting its NDC target. As Chile has not yet submitted an updated NDC since signing this pledge, it is not included in its NDC. Nevertheless, Chile’s NDC specifically states that methane is considered in the GHG target, and includes a measure on building new waste treatment plants that better manage methane by 2035 (Government of Chile, 2020a). Chile’s former environmental minister Marcelo Mena is leading the Global Methane Hub, a hub which offers grants and technical support to implement the Global Methane Pledge.

Chile has over 20 Mha of tree cover and therefore has great natural sinks, particularly in the south of the country (Global Forest Watch, 2024). Although having lost 2.35 Mha, or 12%, in the last 20 years, on average Chile’s LULUCF sinks made up roughly two-thirds of its other emissions (Global Forest Watch, 2024). Net emissions from the sector have ranged from -48 to -78 MtCO2e between 1990 to 2020, with the exception of 2017. Chile should work toward maintaining this LULUCF sink.

Whereas the emission reductions from LULUCF sinks remained relatively stable from 1990 until 2016, the LULUCF sector became an emissions source of 15 MtCO2e in 2017, which can directly be attributed to some of Chile’s worst wildfires in modern history that swept across the country (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2020). This shows how vulnerable these sinks are to extreme weather events, which are expected to increase in frequency and severity. The summer of 2023 was another destructive period with over 400 kha of forest burned (OECD, 2024). CO2 removal through LULUCF is a central part of Chile’s strategy to become GHG neutral in 2050. Therefore, it is extremely important to assure that forests keep acting as sinks and do not turn into emission sources.

At COP26, Chile signed the Leaders' Declaration on Forest and Land Use. While Chile has not updated its NDC since, the sector plays a key role in its current target. In its NDC, Chile committed to a 25% emissions reduction in the forestry sector by 2030, the sustainable management and recovery of 200,000 hectares of native forests, and the afforestation of an additional 200,000 hectares. These actions are estimated to account for 3.9 to 4.6 MtCO2e of annual removals by 2030 (Government of Chile, 2020a). The NDC also commits to identifying peatland and other wetland areas in the national inventory and evaluating their capacity for climate change adaptation or mitigation by 2030.

Chile’s 2020 NDC references the National Strategy for Climate Change and Vegetation Resources (ENCCRV), established in 2013 by the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) through the National Forest Corporation (CONAF), as one of the main tools in reaching the different targets on mitigation related to LULUCF, along with regulations and instruments granting incentives for forest owners to preserve or create new forests. Further, the NDC states that its afforestation target should be in line with Law Nº20.283 on Native Forest Recovery and Forest Promotion, under which afforestation is only undertaken in lands without vegetation and cannot be a substitution of native forests (Government of Chile, 2020a).

However, Chile’s current pace of implementing its LULUCF targets is significantly slower than what is needed to meet its commitments under its NDC. Between 2020 and 2022, only 2 kha were reforested, meaning an additional 198 kha of land would need to be reforested in the next eight years. Similarly, sustainable forest management activities have occurred on only 35 kha of native forests and if this trend continues, Chile will only reach 15% of its target by 2030 (Cortés Lehuei, 2024). Thus, stronger policies to promote reforestation and sustainable native forest management would be needed for Chile to meet its LULUCF targets set under its NDC. At the same time, Chile should avoid relying on LULUCF sinks to meets its climate targets, given the high chance of carbon loss through deforestation or natural disturbance, and should instead prioritise emissions reductions in all other sectors.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions from 1990 to 2022 were taken from the PRIMAP National Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions Database (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023). The data is provided in AR4.

LULUCF data from 1990 to 2020 is taken from the Greenhouse Gas Inventory presented alongside Chile’s Fifth Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2023).


## NDC and other targets

No assumptions or calculations were made with respect to the unconditional NDC target for 2030 as it already included an absolute target for emissions excl. LULUCF. The NDC also included a peak year (2025) and an emissions budget (excl. LULUCF) for the period between 2020 and 2030 (Government of Chile, 2020a). These numbers were taken directly into our calculations and no additional assumptions were needed.

The range for the conditional NDC target has been updated from the previous assessment due to an update in historical emissions. We used the 2016 historical emissions value (incl. LULUCF) from Chile’s latest National Inventory Report (BUR5) to recalculate the new range (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2023).

For the new conditional target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions by 2030, compared to 2016 levels – we assumed that reductions from “net emissions” refers to economy-wide emissions incl. LULUCF. This translates into an emissions target of 25.1 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF) by 2030. Chile has not provided further details on the extent to which it will rely on LULUCF to meet the conditional target, thus we have developed a range based on the following assumptions:

- For the lower end of the range, we assumed that the further emissions reductions needed to meet the conditional target, as compared to the unconditional target, will come from reductions in all sectors except LULUCF. Thus, we assume the 45% reduction would apply to emissions excluding LULUCF. This translates into an 88 MtCO2e emissions level by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). For the same year, we assume the LULUCF sink would remain at -63.1 MtCO2e, its most recent historical value.
- For the upper end of the range, we assumed that the further emissions reductions needed to meet the conditional target as compared to the unconditional target will come entirely from removals in the LULUCF sector. This means emissions excluding LULUCF by 2030 will remain at 95 MtCO2e (as in the unconditional target), while the LULUCF sink increases to -69.9 MtCO2e.

## Current policy projections

Current policy projections have been harmonised to historical emissions up to 2022. We derive our current policy projections using a few different sources.

For the upper range of our current policy projections, we use:

- **Energy CO2 emissions:** based on the Asian and Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2022 Outlook. As this scenario includes all current key policies, no additional calculations were added. These policies include Chile’s Energy Efficiency Law, the retirement of coal plants by 2040, with 65% of coal plant capacity shutting down before 2025, the National Electromobility Strategy, as well as its Hydrogen Strategy (APEC, 2022).
- **Energy non-CO2 emissions:** based on non-CO2 emissions projections from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).
- **Industrial processes, agriculture, and waste emissions:** based on Chile’s Fifth Biennial Update Report (BUR5) (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022).
For the lower range of our current policy projections, we use:

- **All sectors, including energy:** based on the ‘Transición tardía’ projections from Chile’s Fifth Biennial Report (Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, 2022).
For ‘other’ sector emissions in both scenarios, we have taken a 10-year historical trend (2010-2019) from PRIMAP (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2023).

We also compared our current policy projections to those from Observatorio de Carbono Neutralidad (across all sectors) harmonised to 2022 emissions, but this currently falls between the lower and upper end of our CPP (Observatorio de Carbono Neutralidad, 2024).

Some policy developments such as the update on the Distributed Generation Law (also referred to as the “Net Billing” Law) (Law 20.571), which triples the capacity threshold for installed capacity for projects of self-consumption, are not quantified due to lack of available data.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

Chile has committed to being net-zero by 2050. According to Chile’s long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC, the target includes a LULUCF sink of 65 MtCO2e to neutralise remaining emissions. Thus, we estimate Chile’s total GHG emissions excluding LULUCF in 2050 to be 65 MtCO2e (Gobierno de Chile, 2021).


## Global Warming Potentials values

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


## Black carbon

Black carbon can have both a warming and a cooling effect in the atmosphere, depending on where it is: black carbon on snow reduces the albedo of the surface and thus leads to warming. It also leads to higher local temperature of the snow and thus to higher rate of snow melt. Both cooling and warming effects can emerge from interferences with other particles in the atmosphere (depending on the exact conditions). The IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) indicates a net-positive effect of black carbon on warming over time, i.e. in sum, black carbon has contributed more to warming than cooling over the last centuries (Szopa et al., 2021). AR6 also reports an increase in the radiative forcing of black carbon over time, meaning that the warming effects are growing more strongly than the cooling effects.

The IPCC concludes that reducing emissions of black carbon (as well as other anthropogenic emissions like methane) in the short term would contribute to limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C. Along with the decarbonisation of the energy system that is required for 1.5°C, black carbon decreases in the 1.5°C compatible scenarios analysed in the IPCC's 6th Assessment Report.

The climate response of black carbon differs from greenhouse gases in terms of the geographical reach of its impacts, its lifetime, and its interactions with other particles and gases in the atmosphere. The IPCC therefore does not provide any estimate of the global warming potential of black carbon


# Targets


## Target Overview

Chile’s submitted its updated 2020 NDC to the UNFCCC in April 2020 (Government of Chile, 2020a). It includes two 2030 emissions reduction targets: an absolute unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e or a budget of 1,100 MtCO2e (2020–2030) and an emissions reduction target of up to 45% net GHG emissions conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. With the approval of the Climate Change Framework Law in June 2020, this target is legally binding.

Chile also announced a net zero GHG target for 2050 which was enshrined in law in June 2022 with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).


## NDC updates

On 9 April 2020, the Chilean government officially submitted its updated NDC (Government of Chile, 2020a), which is more ambitious than its first NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in 2017 and also slightly more ambitious than an earlier 2019 draft NDC. We rate both Chile’s conditional 2030 NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and its unconditional target against its fair-share contributions to be “Almost sufficient”. Chile needs to make some improvements to its targets if it aims to become compatible with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5° limit.

According to our calculations, by implementing all its current policies, Chile has already peaked its emissions ahead of the proposed peak year of 2025 ─ which would be a remarkable achievement and makes the country a frontrunner in climate action. Under this scenario, the GHG emissions budget between 2020 and 2030 would be in line with the GHG emissions budget of 1,100 presented in the 2020 NDC, according to our calculations.

The updated NDC is stronger in various ways:

- It has a target of 95 MtCO2e in 2030, which is 2 MtCO2e lower than the 2019 draft NDC and significantly lower than the emissions that would have resulted from the 2017 unconditional target (131 MtCO2e);
- It includes an updated goal to peak GHG emissions by 2025, two years earlier than the previous draft;
- It includes an updated GHG emissions budget to 2030, which is smaller than the original draft.
Both the unconditional and conditional NDCs include the following three targets for the LULUCF sector:

- Sustainable management and recovery of 200,000 hectares of native forest, equivalent to GHG emissions capture between 0.9 and 1.2 MtCO2e/year by 2030;
- Reforestation of 200,000 hectares of forest, from which at least half correspond to permanent forest coverage, from which at least 70,000 hectares should be native species. This is equivalent to GHG emissions capture of 3–3.4 MtCO2e/year by 2030;
- Reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation of native forest by 25% by 2030 compared to average emissions between 2001–2013.

- 09.04.2020 “Chile submitted an NDC update”

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emission pathways ("modelled domestic pathways"). Most developing countries may need support to achieve emissions reductions in line with their share of a global least-cost pathway to achieving the 1.5°C long-term temperature goal.

Chile has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources, and one that is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions and may require international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target, which Chile refers to as its ‘internationally supported’ target, against the level of reductions needed according to the modelled domestic pathways.

Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**We rate Chile’s 2030 conditional NDC target – a reduction of up to 45% in net emissions by 2030, subject to international support – as “Almost sufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways.** This rating indicates that Chile’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C. To improve its rating and be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, Chile could increase the ambition of its conditional 2030 climate target equivalent to an absolute emissions limit of 78 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF in 2030 and, if necessary, outline the international support that it would need to achieve it.

While Chile does not explicitly ask for international finance, the NDC states that the 45% reduction target is conditional on specific financial, markets, technological and political conditions. On balance, however, the CAT methodology shows that provision of a small amount of international support is consistent with the wide range of literature on fair share contributions to meeting the Paris Agreement’s goals.

The 2020 NDC links the 2030 target to the long-term goal for GHG neutrality by 2050, as well as to planning processes involving governance and existing and future strategies, including the “Long-term Climate Strategy 2050.” According to the NDC text, the current NDC planning and update process should allow for the NDC and its consecutive iterations to be intermediate milestones to achieve the 2050 neutrality goal, i.e. taking into account the necessary measures to reach the goal (Government of Chile, 2020a).

It also includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions by at least 25% by 2030 below 2016 emission levels.

**Black Carbon and Chile’s NDC**

Chile’s 2020 NDC update includes a target to reduce black carbon emissions, which has substantial co-benefits for human health. However, reductions in black carbon are generally not additional to reductions in CO2, because large fractions of black carbon emissions stem from the same emission sources as CO2. Emission reduction policies therefore often reduce CO2 and black carbon simultaneously, and this is already included in calculations of the emissions reductions required to hold warming well below 2°C globally, like the “emissions gap” and “fair share” reductions (see section on Fair Share).

In its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), the IPCC does not provide calculations of Global Warming Potential for black carbon comparable to those provided for greenhouse gases. The report indicates a net-positive effect on warming of black carbon over time and concludes that reducing black carbon emissions in the short-term would contribute to limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C.

For information on Chile’s 2019 draft NDC or its original submission in 2017, see our comparison assessment of Chile’s NDCs and the previous country assessment of the 2017 NDC submission.

Unconditional NDC target against fair share

**We rate Chile’s 2030 unconditional NDC target as “Almost sufficient ” when compared to its fair-share contribution to climate action**. The “Almost sufficient ” rating indicates that Chile’s unconditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. Chile’s target is within the range of what is considered to be a fair global effort, but would require other countries to make deeper reductions and comparably greater effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Chile’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

The unconditional NDC target rating has changed from “Insufficient” to “Almost sufficient”. However, this change is due to a literature update to our fair share (FS) ranges, which aligns our equity approaches with international environmental law (Rajamani et al., 2021) and therefore exclude studies based on cost-effectiveness; we also include additional studies to reflect the latest research available in the field. The change of ratings does not represent improved climate ambition, compared to our previous assessment.


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**We evaluate the net zero target as: Acceptable.**

Chile announced its net zero target for 2050 as proposed legislation in the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2020 (President of Chile, 2020) and included it in the updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in the same year (Government of Chile, 2020b). In November 2021, the target was also included in the LTS and, since June 2022, it is enshrined in law with the passing of the Framework Law on Climate Change (Congreso Nacional de Chile, 2022).

Chile’s net zero target covers most key elements. It covers all sectors and gases, communicates strategic goals and emissions targets per sector, and provides a detailed methodological framework. Notably, Chile underpins these sector-specific ambitions with detailed emissions pathway analyses and budgets. While Chile does not actively outline any plans to rely on reductions and removals outside its borders, future iterations of its NDC could explicitly rule out international credits.

Chile could further improve its net zero target by considering good practice standards for a few elements. It could include international aviation and shipping in its target’s scope, and explicitly elaborate on fairness considerations.
