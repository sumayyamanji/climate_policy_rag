# Summary


## Overview

**European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated her mandate for the next four years is to continue to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal (EGD), but will focus on implementation rather than increasing ambition. The EU has made significant progress in adopting the measures of the European Green Deal bringing it closer to achieving its 2030 target, but more action is required to close the gap.**

**However, the EU is not fully on track to meet its 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% below 1990 (including** **LULUCF). The CAT therefore rates the EU’s overall climate action and current 2030 emissions reduction target as ‘Insufficient’.**

**The Commission's proposed 2040 target is a net 90% reduction in emissions below 1990, which represents the least ambitious end of the 90–95% range** **proposed** **by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC).**

**The EU does not yet have a target specifically for 2035 emission reductions. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at** **least 74% (excl. LULUCF), or a 78% reduction (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance and other support for developing countries.**

The CAT finds that the EU’s proposed 2040 target of at least 90–95% reduction (including LULUCF) results in an emissions reduction of 85% when excluding LULUCF. This emission reduction target for 2040 would be consistent with 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways. There remains an open question however as to whether or not the emission pathway of the European Union from 2030 through 2040 is 1.5° aligned as whole and that can only be assessed once the European Union has submitted the relevant targets.

The EU has signalled that it recognises the importance of scaling up international climate finance and while it has been increasing its contributions, it would need drastically increase its financial support to achieve its own commitments. Positively, the EU has worked to mobilise more private finance, through for example the EU Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to make sustainable investments more transparent. The latter is currently being assessed to address its shortfalls around its sustainability criteria.

In 2023 at COP28, the EU called for a global phase-out of “unabated” fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies not used for a just transition, however the European Union has not yet moved to establish concrete domestic phase out targets for fossil fuels which would be needed to operationalise the transition away from these fuels as a matter of urgency. As a major importer of fossil fuels this will be an important initiative.

The EU has made significant progress over the past four years with the European Green Deal. Prior to the EGD, in 2019 the EU’s planned policies were projected to achieve only a 33% emission reduction by 2030 below 1990 levels. With its current planned policies, it is on track to achieve a 52% reduction. In 2024 alone, the EU successfully adopted key proposals under the EGD. Some of the major accomplishments included the revisions of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, the Gas Regulation and Directive and the Methane Regulation. Positively these packages:

- Establish more ambitious mandates for renovating Europe’s buildings to be more efficient than before and signal a shift to move away from fossil fuels.
- Establish a framework for a hydrogen market, enabling the scaling up of hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of certain sectors such as industry and shipping.
- Introduce new requirements for the fossil fuel industry to monitory and report methane emission and to take appropriate mitigation measures to abate their emissions.
While these are positive steps in the right direction, many gaps and loopholes in these regulations remain and in some cases were missed opportunities to establish fossil fuel phase out and sector specific targets. To continue improving its climate action, the EU should:

- **Stop investing in additional fossil gas infrastructure and focus its efforts on the renewable energy transition.** This would also entail closing loopholes which make exceptions for fossil fuels, particularly LNG, to prevent the risk of long-term lock-in investments,
- **Agree to a full phase out fossil fuels** across all sectors, with coal phased out altogether by 2030, and fossil gas by 2035,
- **Strictly limit its dependence on carbon capture and storage** through to 2050 to only those sectors where there is no reasonable alternative to abatement at source or whole of system changes that could be deployed to eliminate CO2 emissions without the application of CCS. The EU should not allow CCS in the power sector as the sector can decarbonise completely without this technology,
- **Agree on an ambitious 2035 target** of at least 78% below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) and including fossil fuel phase-out dates,
- **Substantially increase its climate finance contributions**, including through returning revenues from the new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support decarbonisation in developing countries, and
- **Update its long-term strategy for reaching its net zero target**, especially given that the EU Commission has assessed Member States’ progress towards the EU’s climate neutrality target as insufficient.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the EU’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution and to modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, the EU should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target for 2030 to at least 62% (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) below 1990, close gaps and remove loopholes in existing policies prolonging fossil fuel use, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation.

The EU’s policies and action are also rated “Insufficient”. With the full implementation of the EU’s planned policies under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU initiatives the EU will come close to meeting its NDC target for 2030. However, not all proposals under the Fit for 55 package have been adopted. Targets and measures under available member states’ National Energy and Climate Plans are also failing to meet the EU’s targets, and half of member states have not submitted these plans. The overall lack of ambition of the EU’s 2030 NDC target will mean that it will need to adopt more rapid and deeper emission reduction measures later, in order to achieve a 1.5°C compatible pathway to climate neutrality by mid-century.

Current and planned policies will not be enough for the EU to reach its NDC target. The CAT rates the EU’s climate policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. This represents no change from the previous assessment as there have been no major new policy developments.

Since our last assessment (February 2024), the EU has adopted several proposals, such as the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. However, others are still on the table, most notably the 2040 climate targets and Energy Taxation Directive, which we consider under our updated planned policies projections.

The upper bound of our policies and action emissions projection range is based on policies reported by member states in 2023, which would result in an emissions reduction of around 43% (excl. LULUCF) below 1990 by 2030. The bottom end of the range is based on policies adopted at the EU level, including the stronger binding renewable energy target (42.5%), which would result in reducing emissions by 49% (excl. LULUCF).

Our updated planned policies projection shows the EU comes close to achieving its NDC if all its proposals under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are implemented, achieving a 51% emissions reduction from 1990. The projection includes the EU’s indicative renewable energy goal (45%) and additional measures planned.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

In October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC with a target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) - which is the same as the previous EU NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e, implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the 2030 target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are rated as “Insufficient”. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its climate finance contributions in the period post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of international fossil finance.

The EU’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share target rating, and the CAT rates the EU’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

The EU’s climate neutrality target performs moderately in terms of its architecture, transparency, and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process. At present, a finalised clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing but indicate assumptions are provided in the proposed 2040 targets but these are yet to be formalised. We evaluate the net zero target design as “Acceptable”.

**The full net zero target analysis can be found** **here.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the EU’s net zero target as: **Acceptable.**

In 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, which enshrines its collective objective of achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.”

The EU’s climate–neutrality - or, essentially, net zero GHG emissions – target is acceptable in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, with a regular review and assessment process.

There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the European Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

As required under the Climate Law, the Commission has assessed in 2023 the progress of the EU’s climate policy towards meeting its net zero target for the first time (European Commission, 2023a). The Commission found progress to be insufficient. The assessment stresses that all parts of the Fit-for-55 legislative package must be rapidly implemented and that the EU and its member states need to significantly increase the pace of emissions reductions, to almost triple the average annual reduction achieved over the last decade (European Commission, 2023a).

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The EU aims to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest, with net negative emissions thereafter.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy.
- **International aviation and maritime transport** – The target only covers international aviation. The EU has adopted policies partially covering international maritime emissions, however, this bunker is not covered in its final targets. Both international aviation and maritime emissions are not clearly mentioned in the European Climate Law.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The EU plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and will not use removals outside its borders. The European Climate Law states that the balance between emissions and removals is to be achieved domestically.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The EU passed its net zero target into law with its European Climate Law in 2021 (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2021). The net zero target is further included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020 (Croatian Presidency and the European Commission, 2020)
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The EU does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets as part of its net zero target. However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b).
- **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a). When it does so, the Commission may include proposals for amendments to the regulation. There is also a provision on the tracking of collective progress of the EU towards the achievement of net zero (Article 5), every five years.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The EU provides transparent pathways for LULUCF and separately for removals and storage. In the Commission’s impact assessment of 2040 targets, pathways for LULUCF and industrial removal across sectors are modelled between 2030 and 2050 (European Commission, 2018c, 2024b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The Climate Law has set an intermediate target of a GHG emissions reduction of 55% by 2030 (below 1990 levels). The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target. In its 2040 target communication, the commission makes reference to climate diplomacy and partnerships to encourage global decarbonisation but does not provide detail on what fair share elements it considers (European Commission, 2024c).

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The EU has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates the EU’s current policies and actions against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With its current policies in place, the EU’s emissions will reach between 2,470 and 2,755 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. This current policies pathway does not set it on track to meet its existing 2030 NDC target of 2,307 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. This represents 3–9% ambition gap. For more details on our projections, see the Assumptions tab.

To be 1.5°C compatible, current policies would need to reach at least 1,815 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

Our planned policies projections of 2,370–2,400 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) reflects the EU’s 2030 indicative renewable energy goal (of a further 2.5%, totalling 45%) as well as policy proposals that have been announced but remain to be adopted, most notably is the Energy Taxation Directive. If the EU adhered to the full list of planned policies, then it would be close to achieving its 2030 NDC target, missing the mark by 1–2%.

The full spectrum of policies proposed and adopted under the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU legislative packages have been effective in improving projected emission reductions by 2030, though some of the regulations are yet to come into effect.

Despite the enormous regulatory exercise that the EU has been pursuing, many gaps still remain, with loopholes and lax enforcement mechanisms in the policy design. Additional action is required to address these issues, including:

## Policy overview

Economy-wide emissions across the EU have continued to fall since 2019, when the new European government at the time came to power, roughly by 6% from 2019 to 2022 (the last available data point). In June 2024, European Parliament elections were held, and President von der Leyen was re-elected as head of the European Commission. The new work plan for the next Commission has signalled a shift towards framing climate action in the context of decarbonising Europe’s industries, focusing on competitiveness on a global stage and an increasing attention towards developing a new market for carbon removals.

In its previous legislative cycle (2019–2024), the European Green Deal which encapsulated the Fit-for-55 package and REPowerEU legislative packages set out a path for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Some key policies and regulations introduced and revised include the:

- Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)
- Energy Efficiency Directive
- new EU ETS II covering transport and buildings
- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
- Effort Sharing Directive
**For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here**

In the past year, the final elements of the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU packages were finalised and adopted prior to the June elections including the; Gas Regulation and Directive, Methane Regulation, Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and Carbon Removal Certification Framework, which are covered in more details for this assessment.

President von der Leyen’s plans to launch a “Clean Industrial Deal” seeking to build upon existing policies to pivot Europe’s industries. The plan focuses on scaling up manufacturing of net-zero emission technologies and investing in skilled workers to satisfy the growing domestic need for net-zero emission technologies, like electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (von der Leyen, 2024a). With this revision to existing industry related policies, the EU aims to become a global competitor with China and the US in the green technology market race. There will be a big push for expanding and improving rail networks and performance, which is a key measure needed to facilitate a modal shift to an alternative less carbon intensive mode of transport compares to airplanes and cars.


## Power sector

The EU has a binding renewable energy target of 42.5%, and an indicative target of 45% by 2030 across all sectors set by the revised Renewable Energy Directive. Under the REPowerEU package, the Commission has indicated that the EU would need to achieve 69% of renewable energy in power generation to achieve this overarching renewable target of 42.5% – 45%. Member states are expected to outline how they will achieve their share of this target in the updated NECPs which were due in June 2024. As of October 2024, only 13 have submitted their final updates.

The draft 2023 NECPs highlighted that their combined ambition was not enough to achieve the EU’s 2030 targets (European Commission, 2023b). While the renewable energy targets in the NECPs have improved, in many cases the NECPs did not include the necessary supporting measures required to achieve the targets. The final member state NECPs missing the submission deadline, and lack of concrete measures, does not instil confidence that member states will adhere to their climate commitments (Climate Action Network, 2024).

Following the June European Parliamentary elections, the incoming Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to increase investments into modernising Europe’s electricity grids over the next legislative cycle (von der Leyen, 2024a). The EU Grid Action Plan announced in November 2023 will be crucial to modernise Europe’s electricity grid to prepare it for the incoming surge of renewables and increased demand for electricity by 2030 (European Commission, 2023c). The plan will invest EUR 584 bn but lacks specific target dates for many of its actions which puts their implementation at risk (Mindekova & Cremona, 2024).


### Coal

The EU’s coal power share has been trending downward for some time and is heading in the right direction but at too slow a pace, with an average annual reduction rate of only 1.1% (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). In May 2023, coal power generation dropped to 12%, an all-time low (Ember, 2023). Overall, usage in the first half of 2023 was down by close to a quarter. To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

The EU signed up to the coal exit pledge at COP26, but did not include the coal exit as part of its 2023 NDC update. While a large majority of the EU member states either don’t use coal power or have an exit date before 2030, a handful still have later dates. As of 2024, 20 EU member states already have no coal in their electricity generation or coal power phase-out dates prior to 2030, while 6 countries have a phase out date beyond 2030 and only one country has not committed to phase out coal entirely (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). In 2023, France, Italy and Hungary delayed their coal exits but still maintain a deadline before 2030 (Beyond Fossil Fuels, 2024).

The EU bloc does not seem to fund coal projects overseas. However, some European investors have investments or shareholdings in coal projects and major coal companies across several non-EU countries including India, China, the US, Indonesia and South Africa, classified as “green”, and amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

The 2021 Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) were supposed to be a transparency framework, introduced to prevent greenwashing and promote more sustainable investing. However it has been ineffective because Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR inadequately categorise green investments. Article 8 is too broad in its sustainability scope, and Article 9 lacks consistency in defining what qualifies as a sustainable investment. The EU is now conducting an assessment on the effectiveness of this legislation (European Commission, 2024f). This presents the Commission with an opportunity to further close its policy gaps and resolve the loopholes for fossil fuel investments.


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2023, about 21% of the EU’s electricity generation came from oil and fossil gas, down by 3% compared to 2022 (Ember, 2024). To be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT finds that the EU would need to phase out fossil gas by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). While fossil gas in electricity generation is on the decline the pace is far too slow.

The EU has agreed to extend its fossil gas demand reduction target until the end of March 2024 (Council of the European Union, 2023b). Continuing to focus on cutting demand and shifting to renewable sources is a positive development. CAT analysis shows that the EU’s fossil gas strategy risks carbon lock-in and undermines global climate action.

In its efforts to move away from Russian gas following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its member states have diversified their fossil gas imports from other countries in the form of LNG. This has been accompanied by massive investment buildout in LNG terminals and gas pipelines to the tune of EUR 84 bn (Rozansk & Hassan, 2024). Consequently, Europe now has an overcapacity of LNG facilities representing long term stranded assets, further exacerbated by the decreasing demand for gas and with consumers bearing the high price of LNG (Jaller-Makarewicz, 2023). LNG imports peaked in spring 2023 and have been on the decline since.

**Revised Gas Package**

The EU recently adopted the revised Gas Directive and Regulation, intended to “shift from fossil gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen, and to establish and regulate the upcoming market for hydrogen” (European Council, 2023). Positively, it requires fossil gas distribution operators to develop plans to decommission gas networks and establishes a new and independent governance structure for the future transmission of hydrogen. This new hydrogen market is intended to prioritise the hard-to-abate sectors but the legislation fails to introduce guardrails to guarantee this. There are other concerns:

- The legislation covers low carbon gases but fails to provide a definition as to what a low carbon gaseous fuel is, risking that low carbon fuels could be derived from fossil fuels.
- Long term fossil gas supply contracts are also allowed to run until 2049.
The gas package was a missed opportunity to introduce a legally binding commitment to phase out fossil gas. The consultation process is still open for the delegated Act to define the criteria and methodology for defining low carbon gaseous fuels, representing an opportunity for the EU to strengthen any weaknesses in the gas package (Climate Action Network Europe, 2024). Needless to say that the current policy direction is still heading in the wrong direction.

There remains a mismatch between current energy needs and the time needed for all of these projects to go online, which makes them difficult to justify as low carbon alternatives when investment in energy efficiency can be brought online instead. The need for such a significant investment in fossil gas infrastructure has been countered by an assessment indicating that the EU can do without Russian gas without investing heavily into fossil fuel infrastructure (European Climate Foundation, 2022).


### Renewables

In 2023, the EU’s power sector ran on 44% of renewable sources (including biomass) (Climate Analytics, 2024). Of this, wind and solar collectively contribute to about 26% (Ember). The CAT finds that to align with 1.5°C the EU should aim to achieve at least 87% of renewables in electricity generation by 2030 and a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The deployment of wind and solar in the EU has been gaining traction in recent years, averaging 2.2% annual growth and is heading in the right direction but the pace is too slow and would need to increase to about 3.1% growth per year (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

**There have been no new policy updates since the CAT’s last assessment. For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here** .


### Nuclear energy

The EU included nuclear energy in the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), recognising it as a "strategic" technology. The NZIA supports nuclear technologies like small modular reactors, highlighting their potential to provide low-carbon energy with minimal waste, crucial for decarbonisation and energy security (European Commission, 2023d). In its 2040 climate target communication, the Commission did not specify any target or actions towards nuclear capacity build up but reaffirms nuclear a low carbon fuel needed to achieve its targets.

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with the flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.


## Industry

The EU’s industrial emissions, both energy related and from industrial processes, accounted for about 24% of its total GHG emissions in 2021 (Climate Analytics, 2024; UNFCCC, 2023). Industrial emissions have been falling on average about 2.3% per year but this is not fast enough and the EU’s industry will need to accelerate this 1.3 times faster than its current trend to reach 1.5°C compatibility (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

The EU has not signed the Beyond Oil and Gas (BOGA) declaration but eight of its member states have. Six member states — Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden — are core members of the Alliance and have committed to ending oil and fossil gas exploration and development (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021).

To decarbonise its industries, the EU introduced indicative targets in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU 2023/2413) for the share of renewables in industry. Article 22 requires the industry sectors in member states to increase the share of renewable energy by an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2021 and 2030. This annual 1.6% indicative benchmark was watered down by the Commission from the initial 1.9% growth rate it estimated it would need to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives (European Commission, 2022a).

The revised Renewable Energy Directive also requires that only 42% of incorporated hydrogen be derived from renewable energy by 2030 and 60% by 2035. This means that the industry will use a mix of renewable and fossil fuel derived hydrogen. This design will allow industries to start their shift to hydrogen but access cheaper fossil fuel derived hydrogen until the green hydrogen is available at scale and affordably. The EU does not have any provisions to fully eliminate fossil fuel derived hydrogen from industry beyond 2035, which risks the long-term dependence on fossil derived hydrogen.

**Green hydrogen**

The Commission’s Hydrogen Strategy sets out that installed capacity of electrolysers in the EU should reach 40 GW by 2030, resulting in the production of up to 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen, complemented with similar capacity installed in neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2020). The EU hydrogen policy framework has several key gaps hindering market development and does not go far enough to address issues such as high-cost entry barriers and uncertainties. At present, renewable hydrogen is also much more expensive than fossil fuel-based hydrogen. Financial support is fragmented, with a shortage of targeted funds necessary to meet the 2030 REPowerEU goals. Additionally, the EU lacks a clear definition for low-carbon hydrogen, and is only expected to develop a methodology by 2025 as part of the Delegated Act of the revised Gas Regulation.

**Developing a net zero technology Industry**

To tackle replacing industrial technology with cleaner alternatives, the EU has been developing a nexus of polices to facilitate the growth of (1) net zero technology industry and (2) industrial carbon removals, encapsulated by the:

- Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) (EU) 2024/1735, and more broadly the Green Industrial Plan
- Industrial Carbon Management Strategy
- Carbon Removal Certification Framework (proposal)
- 2040 climate targets (proposal)
In June 2024, the Net Zero Industry Act entered into force (European Parliament & European Council, 2024c). It focuses on 19 net zero technologies. It also includes the objective of developing annual injection capacity for carbon capture and storage of 50 MtCO2e by 2030 that should be used to mitigate residual emissions. These capacities should be developed by oil and fossil gas companies proportionally to their current oil and gas production levels.

The NZIA will be crucial to operationalising the direction set by the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (ICMS) (European Commission, 2024d). The ICMS lays out how it plans to scale up industrial carbon removals to deliver the EU’s climate neutrality objective, most notably from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs) and direct air carbon capture (DACC).

It sets out a target to reach 50 MtCO2e in carbon removals annually by 2030. The ICMS is strongly linked to the proposed 2040 targets, which are yet to be adopted. In its impact assessment the Commission envisions it would need about 75 MtCO2e of industrial carbon removals from BECCs and DACCs by 2040. Additionally, the Commission will create policy options and support mechanisms for industrial carbon removals, including considerations on whether and how to integrate them into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) but this is not expected until the planned revision of the ETS in 2026 (EPG, 2024).

In April 2024, the political agreement was reached on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) but is still to be adopted (Carbon Gap, 2024a; European Commission, 2022b). The CRCF seeks to establish a framework to certify the emission removals from carbon farming, carbon storage in products and industrial carbon removals (from technologies like Direct Air Carbon Capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs). The CRCF is the mechanism to deliver on the goals of the ICMS and lays out the role the CDR will play. The CRCF gives the Commission the ability to assess options for CDR and CCS targets.

The CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could go against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits.

The 2040 climate target communication keeps the role of CCS in the power sector vague under the proposed 2040 targets. This is worrying as the application of CCS to certain sectors is left open to interpretation. The incoming Commission has the opportunity during the subsequent expansion of the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and Clean Industry Deal to clearly commit to no CCS in the power sector.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to technologies which use engineered methods to capture CO2 from a source and store it geologically. CCS can be applied to a range of different CO2 sources in different sectors. CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally.

Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS doesn't remove 100% of emissions from power plants.


## Transport

Transport is the only major sector in the EU where emissions have increased over the last 30 years: emissions in 2022 followed an upward trend of 2.7% compared to 2021. It is too early to say whether emissions from the sector have peaked: the economic rebound and trend towards bigger vehicles may undermine the impact of increasing EV sales on emission levels.

The EU has introduced several policies and regulations to reduce emissions from the transport sector across all transport modes. These include but are not limited to:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413, through the adoption of sectoral renewable energy targets,
- Revised Regulation strengthening CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans (EU) 2023/851, which established a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035.
- Revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (EU) 2024/1679
- New EU ETS II which covers road transport emissions from 2027
In 2023, electric vehicle (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) made up 22% of vehicle sales. To be 1.5°C compatible in line with the Paris Agreement, the CAT finds that the EU would need to achieve 95–100% sales of light-duty electric vehicle sales by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). This is five years earlier than the EU’s current target of 2035. The EU did not sign the Zero Emissions Vehicle pledge at COP26 and did not include this target in its NDC.

In President von der Leyen’s political guidelines for the next four years in office, she hinted that the 2035 ban on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles might be watered down through the increased use of alternative fuels to achieve the ban (Mathiesen et al., 2024). The ban on fossil fuel car sales has an exemption to allow synthetic e-fuels to continue beyond 2035. Positively, the guidelines also pushes for greater improvements to the EU’s rail network to encourage a stronger modal shift towards rail (von der Leyen, 2024b).

In June 2024, the EU adopted the revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (TEN-T) (European Parliament & European Council, 2024b). The regulation intends to create the enabling conditions to scale up zero emission transport modes, improving connecting and promoting a modal shift to more share and zero mission transport.

While no new transport regulations have been adopted since the last CAT assessment in February 2024, some have been revised or are still pending agreement such as the CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicle and the Green Freight Package.

Gaps still remain for some regulations. For example, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023c) and the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 (European Parliament & European Council, 2023) consider LNG a “low carbon fuel” in shipping. As LNG is a fossil fuel, its prolonged or expanded use will make it difficult to achieve future emission reductions given the long lifetime of ships and infrastructure, resulting in stranded assets.

To reach full decarbonisation in the transport sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to increase the share of zero emission fuels (electricity, hydrogen and biofuels) from 7% in 2019 to 55% by 2030. This covers all modes of domestic transport collectively (i.e. road, rail, domestic aviation and maritime travel) (Climate Action Tracker, 2024).

**Tariffs on Chinese EVs**

In October 2024, the EU Commission announced new tariffs on battery EVs manufactured in China on the basis that the Chinese government unfairly subsidies its EVs, undercutting European car manufacturers. Individual duties will range between 17.4% to 37.6% depending on the Chinese manufacturer (European Commission, 2024e).

To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs continued exponential growth in EV sales, needs a lot of them to meet demand, and needs to make it affordable for consumers (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). One of the major barriers to this is affordability. Chinese EV models sold across EU member states are typically cheaper than European manufactured vehicles, which could affect consumer choices.


## Buildings

In 2021, buildings accounted for 13% of the EU’s total GHG emissions (Climate Analytics, 2024), consuming 40% of the EU’s final energy consumption. The buildings sector has traditionally been heavily reliant on fossil gas and oil. High energy prices triggered by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is having some impact on consumer behaviour and spurring policy action in the sector. GHG emissions in buildings have been steadily falling since 1990, but not fast enough (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a).

The main legislation driving the decarbonisation of the EU’s building sector fall under:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413
- Revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791
- Revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1275
- New EU ETS II which covers buildings sector
The revised Renewable Energy Directive sets an EU wide target to achieve 49% share of renewables in the final energy consumption in buildings by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023a). The revised Energy Efficiency Directive sets a binding target to reduce the final energy consumption by 11.7% relative to the 2020 or a target of 763 Mtoe of final energy consumption by 2030 across all sectors (European Parliament, 2023).

The EED lacks robust measures specifically targeting the building sector, focusing instead on general improvements in energy efficiency and renovation rates linked to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As of early 2024, no updated NECP submissions from member states fully comply with EED requirements, revealing a concerning lack of commitment. Furthermore, only twelve member states recognise the broader renovation obligation for public buildings (Chapelot et al., 2024), highlighting significant implementation gaps that undermine the EU's climate ambitions.

According to the reform of the EU ETS agreed in early 2023, the buildings sector will be covered by a new emissions trading scheme (EU ETS II) from 2027 onward. The requirement to purchase emission allowances to cover the sale of fossil fuels used in the transport and building sectors will further increase the incentive for home insulation and installation of clean sources of heating.

The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), adopted in 2024, includes several important measures aimed at achieving a zero emission building sectors by 2050. One of the most significant changes is the mandate that all new buildings must meet "zero emission" standards by 2030. While a step in the right direction, the proposal was watered down from the EU Commission's initial plan, which called for binding EU-level minimum energy performance standards.

While the EPBD targets a 3.5% annual renovation rate by 2030, which aligns with 1.5°C compatible benchmarks, the EU’s current renovation rate stands at only around 1% annually (Climate Action Tracker, 2020; European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). The Directive also targets the renovation of 15% of the EU's building stock by 2030, but this is widely regarded as insufficient to meet climate goals (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a). The table below provides a summary of the main targets set out in the EPBD (BPIE, 2024).

The revised EPBD missed an opportunity to fully address the issue of locking in fossil fuel heating systems, by introducing an ambiguous ban on fossil fuel boilers by 2040, while it did ban member states from subsiding the installation of fossil fuel boilers from 2025. The 2040 ban leaves the member state to decide whether or not they wish to include this in their national phase-out plans (Verplancke et al., 2024).

The implementation timeline of the revised EPBD is too slow. Key milestones, such as mandatory solar installations for new public and commercial buildings by 2027 and minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings by 2033, push essential changes far into the future. This drawn-out schedule is seen as inadequate to meet the urgent decarbonisation goals needed to address the climate crisis.

To reach full decarbonisation in the buildings sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to reduce the emission intensity (kgCO2/m2) in residential buildings and commercial buildings by 60% and 75% respectively by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. In energy saving terms, the EU would need to reduce the energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 30% and 25%, respectively, by 2030.


## Agriculture

Agriculture accounts for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions in 2021 (UNFCCC, 2023). The EU agricultural sector generates about 60% of its emissions from methane, nearly all of which come from livestock, primarily through enteric fermentation and manure management (Eurostat, 2022). Despite this, methane reduction efforts remain insufficient.

While the EU is a co-initiator of the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to cut global methane emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, only 11 member states have committed to reducing methane from livestock, covering less than 3% of the EU’s livestock units. Leaked reports indicate the EU is not on track to meet its methane reduction target, signifying the need for stronger measures (Ainger, 2022; Changing Markets, 2022). Previous Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) efforts from 2014–2020 had limited success in cutting emissions, focusing instead on increasing CO2 removals (European Union, 2022).

Early 2024 saw widespread protests by farmers against the climate and nature regulations under the Green Deal reach a fever-pitch across many member states, particularly around cutting subsidies for fossil fuels and pesticides (Dwyer, 2024). This prompted the EU to backtrack on some of its initiatives to cut emissions from agriculture under the proposed 2040 target, including on introducing sectoral targets for the first time. The Commission also rapidly passed a new regulation (EU 2024/1468) to limit some of the environmental requirements for farmers under the CAP (2023-2027), which weakened its environmental impact (European Parliament & European Council, 2024a).

The European Court of Auditors (ECA) criticised the 2023–2027 CAP strategic plans for falling short of the EU’s climate and environmental ambitions. Despite being more ambitious than previous plans, the new CAP still lacks alignment with the European Green Deal targets. The ECA recommended that the Commission promote more environmental best practices, estimate CAP’s contribution to the Green Deal, and improve its monitoring of climate and environmental outcomes (ECA, 2024).

Key to the EU achieving its 2040 targets would be the introduction of an emission reductions target for the agricultural sector combined with a levy on agricultural emission. In June 2024, Denmark took a first step in this direction by becoming the first country to introduce an agricultural carbon tax and is pushing for this to be applied at an EU level (Mooney et al., 2024) .

The influence of farmer protests were significant enough to mark a shift in the EU’s tone on regulating farmers. Critically, the EU will need to find alternative pathways in supporting farmers as they transition to decarbonise and adapt to climate impacts but continuing with exemptions risks failing to deliver on net zero by 2050.


## Forestry

Since 1990, the land use, land-use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) had constituted a sink of emissions averaging around 300 MtCO2e. However, since 2017, the sink has decreased significantly, amounting to around 230 MtCO2e in 2021.

The EU recently agreed to revisions to the LULUCF regulation (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023d), which governs the sector. It increased its 2030 target to 310 MtCO2e, up from the 225 MtCO2e limit referenced in its Climate Law. The revisions included individual targets for each member state towards the 310 MtCO2e level. While enhancing the size of the land sink is positive, it should not undermine the level of ambition in other sectors.

The EU’s incoming Carbon Removal Certification Framework will also have ramifications for emission in the forestry sector (Carbon Gap, 2024b; European Commission, 2022c). Worryingly, the CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could work against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits (EEB, 2024). **For more details on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework, see the Industry section.**

In the impact assessment for the 2040 climate targets, while not yet proposed, modelling indicated that the removals from LULUCF in 2040 could amount to somewhere between 215 MtCO2e and 376 MtCO2e with 317 MtCO2e as the central value(European Commission, 2024b). Our assessment of the EU’s proposed 2040 target indicates that the EU intends to achieve 86% emissions reductions by 2040 compared to 1990, excluding LULUCF emissions but including removals from industrial technologies such as DACCS and BECCS. This means that the EU will need to rely on expanding its LULUCF sink to achieve the remain 4–9% emission reductions. Additionally, even the largest estimated LULUCF sink of 376 MtCO2e under consideration is not sufficient to reach the 95% emission reduction.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions have continuously fallen since the mid-90s, dropping by 40% between 1990 and 2021 (European Environment Agency, 2023a).

Regulation of waste sector emissions is covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), along with those from transport, buildings, and agriculture. Combined, emissions from these sectors needs to decrease by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023e).

As of 2024, the European Parliament has voted to strengthen the proposed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles. The European Parliament's approval of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for textiles is seen as a step forward, but it lacks specific waste prevention targets and effective management strategies.

Meanwhile, the EU Council has prioritised textile reforms, neglecting critical food waste reduction measures. This approach is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, highlighting the need for stronger commitments to ensure both textile and food waste are managed effectively for sustainable outcomes (Zero Waste Europe, 2024) . The current design may not adequately incentivise producers to improve product design for longevity and recyclability, with some suggesting that the focus remains too heavily on waste management rather than preventing waste generation.


## Methane

In 2022, methane emissions accounted for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions. The majority of these emissions came from the agricultural sector, followed by waste management and energy. Methane emissions have fallen about 60% since 1990 (UNFCCC, 2024).

The EU signed the methane pledge at COP26 in 2021. Methane is covered in the overall scope of the EU’s latest NDC from 2023 but is also specifically mentioned in the context of mitigating methane emissions from maritime transport under the revised EU ETS. In 2020, the EU released its methane reduction strategy laying out its intention to cut emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste.

As part of the strategy, in 2024, the EU adopted the regulation on methane emission reduction in the energy sector (EU) 2024/1787 (European Parliament & European Council, 2024d), covering emissions from oil and fossil gas exploration, production, transmission, distribution, coal mining and imports of fossil fuels.

The regulation introduces new measures to measure, report and verify (MRV) methane emissions, methane abatement measures and a ban on routine venting and flaring. While a step in the right direction, the regulation does not go far enough – starting with the lack of an overarching methane reduction target and prolonged implementation timeline, which does not reflect the urgency and pace needed.

In addition, many exemptions and loopholes diminish the regulation's effectiveness. The regulation excludes the petrochemical sector and LNG consumption. Methane intensive LNG can be expected to grow considerably, given the signal that other EU polices are pushing. For example, the FuelEU Maritime for LNG fuel in shipping, as well as the build up of LNG infrastructure over the past few years following the shift away from imported Russian gas (Climate Action Network Europe, 2023). A recent study finds that LNG as a fuel has an emission footprint 33% greater than that of coal due to the associated methane leakage (Howarth, 2024). Additionally, despite representing the largest source of methane, the agricultural sector is not included. Instead, it is counted under the overall GHG emission reduction target for member states under the Revised Effort Sharing Directive.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions between 1990 and 2022 are based on the national inventory submitted by the EU to the UNFCCC (European Environment Agency, 2024). The data is presented in AR5 GWP values, so we convert it to AR4 GWP using gas-by-gas conversions.


## NDC and other targets

Since our last update in February 2024, the CAT has not changed its methodology for quantifying the EU’s 2030 absolute emissions target. Our current approach aligns with the EEA’s quantification of the target (European Environment Agency, 2023c). Note that the EEA’s NDC quantification includes international aviation.

- We take the EU’s 1990 emissions including LULUCF in AR5 GWP, excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation, and apply a 55% reduction to this value (European Environment Agency, 2024).
- Then we add the difference between the sink (217 MtCO2e) in 1990 and the sink of 225 MtCO2e that the EU is allowed to use towards achieving its NDC target as outlined in the European Climate Law.
- As the CAT excludes LULUCF from absolute target values, we then remove sink of 225 MtCO2e and convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.
While the LULUCF Regulation, passed in April 2023, adopts an EU-wide LULUCF sink of 310 MtCO2e, the EU has made clear that this additional sink capacity will help it exceed its 55% target and not count towards achieving it (European Parliament, 2022; European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023b). As such, we do not exclude this additional LULUCF capacity from our quantification of the target.

CO2 emissions from intra-EU flights, (as well as those departing flights to Switzerland and the United Kingdom) fall within the scope of the NDC as they are covered under the EU ETS. However, we do not consider these emissions to be part of the target quantification itself (as described above), but relevant to assessing compliance with it. As such, intra-EU CO2 aviation are not included in our NDC target calculations.


## Current policy projections

The assessment of the EU’s policy projections reflects both policies and measures implemented at the national level (the top end of our range), as well as these adopted at the EU level but not yet transposed by the Member States (the bottom end of our range).

To reflect policies adopted at the national level, we use the EEA’s compilation of national projections prepared by Member States in 2023 (European Environment Agency, 2023b). We apply the growth rate from the ‘with existing measures’ (WEM) scenario for total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) to total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) in 2022.

To calculate the bottom end of the range, we replace estimates for power CO2 emissions in the States Policies (STEPS) projections from the World Energy Outlook (WEO) with those from the Announced Pledges (APS) to account for the implementation of the 42.5% RE share in final gross consumption in the Fit for 55 package. From the Fit for 55 modelled projections, we take the MIX scenario which better reflects the current policies in place.

We then take the growth rate of this revised projection for total CO2 emissions from WEO and apply that to total GHG emission from the energy sector in 2022 and extend out to 2035. Non-CO2 emissions represent about 3% of energy sector emissions, so we think WEO is a good proxy for the entire sector. For all other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 WEM scenario to extend each sector out to 2035 individually.

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Planned policy projections

We provide a range of projections for the EU’s planned policies.

To develop a planned policies projection for the bottom of the range (i.e. maximum emission reductions), we modified our energy sector estimate to take into account the 45% indicative RE target, up from the 42.5% included in our current policy projections’ lower bound. For the other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 ‘with additional measures’ (WAM) scenario to extend each sector out to 2030 individually.

To devise the modified energy sector estimate, we took the energy emissions projections from the lower range of our current policy projection and multiplied it by the ratio between projected total energy emissions in 2030 with a 42.5% RE binding target compared to a 45% RE indicative target. We interpolated the data between total energy emissions in 2022 to this adjusted value for 2030 to complete the timeseries.

To calculate the ratio indicated above, we started with the 2030 emissions estimates provided by the European Commission in its initial modelling of the higher emissions reduction goal published in 2021 (European Commission, 2021c). We select the MIX scenario for the 2030 domestic energy related CO2 emissions (i.e. excluding international aviation and shipping). This modelling assumed a renewable energy share of 40% and when corrected to remove international bunkers, assumes a final energy consumption of 751 Mtoe.

We calculated the emissions intensity for energy CO2 emissions and then adjusted this figure to reflect the higher renewable energy share adopted by the EU (42.5% and 45%). To calculate energy CO2 emissions we used this revised emissions intensity value and the Energy Efficiency Directive’s final energy consumption target of 11.7% below the 2020 EU Reference scenario we which calculate to be 726 Mtoe, excluding international aviation in 2030.

We used the 2021 ratio between energy CO2 and all gases to estimate total emissions in 2030. For the other value in the ratio, we applied the same methods as indicated earlier but used the indicative additional target included in the Renewable Energy Directive of 2.5% (or 45% share total).

To develop a planned policies projection for the upper end of the range (i.e. minimal emission reductions), we take the projected GHG emissions under the S3 scenario from the 2040 target communication impact assessment by the European Commission (in AR5) and convert it to AR4 while at the same time removing the influence of international aviation. In the EU’s Fit for 55 modelling scenarios, international aviation is included in the final energy consumption and GHG emissions (European Commission, 2021b). To omit it, we subtract the international aviation energy consumption and GHG emissions from the totals.


## Proposed 2040 target

We take the EU’s modelled 2040 target from the S3 scenario presented in its impact assessment (European Commission, 2024b). We substitute the emissions from LULUCF in AR5 GWP and also excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation. We exclude the LULUCF emission but add in the planned assumptions for industrial carbon removals which include Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACCs) and Bioenergy Carbon Capture (BECCs). Regardless of scenario industrial removals are set at 75 MtCO2e. Finally, we convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.

This results in an emission reduction of 86% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels. We then apply the range of LULUCF assumptions (215, 317 and 376 MtCO2e) to determine the resulting emission reductions percentages from 1990. Building on the 85% baseline emission reductions, the added LULUCF options would resulting in 90%, 92% and 94% emissions reductions.


## Net-zero target

In December 2018, the European Commission published its assessment of the climate neutrality goal by 2050 for the EU28 (European Commission, 2018a, 2018c, 2018b). In 2024, as part of the EU’s 2040 target proposal’s Impact Assessment (European Commission, 2024b), new data was made available on the emission projections to 2050. Out of the four scenarios, we take the S3 scenario which best reflects the likely pathway the EU has indicated it will strive for.

We take the GHG emission in 2050 (excluding LULUCF) in AR5 and add in the assumed industrial carbon removals from DACCs and BECCs from the 2040 Target Impact Assessment. We provide a single projection and not a range based on the S3 scenario in the 2040 target impact assessment. This approach reflects what the EU Commission said it will pursue. We convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990 to get 295 MtCO2e as our target excluding LULUCF.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Some of the EU data used in our calculations is based on AR5 values. Please see the individual sections above for our conversion methods.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In October 2023, the EU submitted a revised NDC to the UNFCCC (Spain and the European Commission, 2023). Its target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e which is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target. The CAT rates this updated target as ‘did not increase ambition’ because it does not lead to a lower emissions limit (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) compared to the previous NDC.

Compared to the previous NDC update in 2020, this NDC update clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the goal.

The EU’s 2030 NDC is not close to the 1.5°C limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. It remains far behind on its fair share contribution to the 1.5°C limit and needs to substantially increase its support for emissions reductions abroad and climate finance.

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels. The CAT quantifies the 2040 target to be 660 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) or an 85% reduction from 1990. While the 2040 target does align with what would at least be needed domestically to be aligned with 1.5°C compared to modelled domestic pathways, the CAT believes that the EU should adopt at least a 95% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) by 2040 seeing as it is is failing to contribute its fair share to global climate action.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC submission from October 2023, the EU kept the same headline target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) as in its submission from December 2020 (Spain and the European Commission, 2023).

The updated NDC has increased the EU’s target for LULUCF removals to 310 MtCO2e up from 225 MtCO2e. The increase in the LULUCF sink is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target (European Parliament, 2022). However, if the EU were to use the additional 85 MtCO2e towards achieving its 2030 target – rather than the 225 MtCO2e referenced in the European Climate Law – then this would decrease the emissions reductions needed in other sectors. The CAT does not view this submission as representing an increase in ambition.

Other than the increase in the LULUCF sink, the most recent EU NDC update includes a summary of regulatory developments, and the main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed to in December 2020. It also clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the target. Based on this clarification, the CAT considers international aviation to be included in the EU’s NDC, but not international maritime emissions. Please see the Assumptions tab for more details on the quantification of the EU’s 2030 NDC.

The EU had previously submitted an update to its NDC in December 2020 (Germany & European Commission, 2020). The 2020 update provided a strengthened 2030 emissions reduction target of “at least 55%” compared to the first NDC’s target of “at least 40%” (Latvia and the European Commission, 2015). The inclusion of the land sector slightly weakens this target compared to its 2016 NDC, however, the inclusion of aviation strengthens it.

According to the Commission’s modelling reflecting the “Fit for 55” package, the EU’s emissions would amount to 2.2 GtCO2e in 2030, excluding LULUCF and international aviation[1] (European Commission, 2021a). As of the end of 2023, the EU has all the “Fit for 55” legislative framework in place to meet its “at least 55%” target. These policies still fall short of the domestic reductions needed to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Domestic emission reductions of at least 62% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) from 1990 are needed to make the EU’s effort compatible with 1.5°C, while currently the EU’s target results in a 52% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) reduction from 1990.

The EU is expected to submit an updated NDC with a target for 2035 at COP30 in 2025, but will likely folllowing the adoption of its 2040 target. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at least 74% excluding LULUCF, or a 78% reduction including LULUCF below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance. The European Commission suggests deriving the EU’s 2035 NDC from a linear trajectory between its 2030 and 2040 targets. The CAT would advocate for a non-linear trajectory based on 1.5°C compatible pathways, as delayed climate action only makes limiting warming to 1.5°C more difficult.

[1] The numbers provided in the scenario use Global Warming Potential from IPCC AR5. For the sake of comparability with other countries assessed by the Climate Action Tracker the number 2.256 MtCO2e is translated to AR4 resulting in 2.244 MtCO2e.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The EU does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

On October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC. The target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the EU’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” and is not enough to improve the EU’s fair share rating.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are higher than those of most other governments, but we still rate it “Insufficient.” The EU has committed to increasing its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel finance abroad. In its concluded negotiation position for the upcoming CO29, the EU neglects to address the need for significantly scaled-up financial support for developing countries, a key factor for enabling ambitious climate action and ensuring a fair global transition.

In 2022, the EU and its member states provided EUR 28.5 bn to developing countries (Council of the European Union, 2023a), but contributions still fall short of its fair share contribution. The EU remains committed through 2025 to the USD 100 bn collective goal of climate finance for developing countries, but the USD 100 bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period. The EU has not made clear how much its planned international climate finance contributions will be in the coming years.

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation Framework (SFDR) was established to promote transparency in sustainable investments to support informed investment decisions. However, this has failed due to broad and vague definitions of what constitute green investments. For example, European investment funds labelled as ”green” under the SFDR have been directed towards major coal firms outside the EU, including the US, China and India, amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

In February 2022, European Commission published a complementary climate-delegated act to its Taxonomy Regulation (Council of the European Union, 2022a), which states that energy generation from fossil gas and nuclear should be classified as transition activities: activities that cannot yet be replaced by low carbon alternatives but that do contribute to emissions reduction.

At COP29, the EU has reaffirmed that international public climate finance be focused on delivering on the New Collective Qualified Goal (NCQG). However, the EU has not indicated how much finance the bloc is ready to commit and has added a prerequisite to expand the number of contributors part of its position (CAN Europe, 2024).

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**New 2040 target proposed in February 2024**

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels (European Commission, 2024c). After the elections for the European Parliament, President von der Leyen reaffirmed support for the 90% target (von der Leyen, 2024a), which represents the least ambitious end of the 90-95% range initially recommended by the ESABCC (European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), 2023). Based on the assumptions in the EU’s Impact Assessment for the 2040 target (European Commission, 2024a), we quantify the target as an 85% emissions reduction from 1990 or 660 MtCO2e by 2040 (excluding LULUCF but including industrial removals from DACCs and BECCS). This means that the EU will rely on increasing its LULUCF sinks to achieve the remaining 5–10%. The EU seems unlikely to be able to achieve the upper end of the range because even with its most ambitious LULUCF sink the EU would only able to reach a 94% total emissions reduction in 2040 from 1990.

**Net zero target**

In April 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, setting into law the objective of collectively achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.” The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as agreed in the European Council’s conclusions from December 2019, has further been included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020.

The EU’s climate neutrality – or, essentially, net zero – target is “Acceptable” in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process.

At present, a clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing, although this is an element that is required of the forthcoming 2040 target. There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

**The full analysis is available** **here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated her mandate for the next four years is to continue to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal (EGD), but will focus on implementation rather than increasing ambition. The EU has made significant progress in adopting the measures of the European Green Deal bringing it closer to achieving its 2030 target, but more action is required to close the gap.**

**However, the EU is not fully on track to meet its 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% below 1990 (including** **LULUCF). The CAT therefore rates the EU’s overall climate action and current 2030 emissions reduction target as ‘Insufficient’.**

**The Commission's proposed 2040 target is a net 90% reduction in emissions below 1990, which represents the least ambitious end of the 90–95% range** **proposed** **by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC).**

**The EU does not yet have a target specifically for 2035 emission reductions. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at** **least 74% (excl. LULUCF), or a 78% reduction (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance and other support for developing countries.**

The CAT finds that the EU’s proposed 2040 target of at least 90–95% reduction (including LULUCF) results in an emissions reduction of 85% when excluding LULUCF. This emission reduction target for 2040 would be consistent with 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways. There remains an open question however as to whether or not the emission pathway of the European Union from 2030 through 2040 is 1.5° aligned as whole and that can only be assessed once the European Union has submitted the relevant targets.

The EU has signalled that it recognises the importance of scaling up international climate finance and while it has been increasing its contributions, it would need drastically increase its financial support to achieve its own commitments. Positively, the EU has worked to mobilise more private finance, through for example the EU Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to make sustainable investments more transparent. The latter is currently being assessed to address its shortfalls around its sustainability criteria.

In 2023 at COP28, the EU called for a global phase-out of “unabated” fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies not used for a just transition, however the European Union has not yet moved to establish concrete domestic phase out targets for fossil fuels which would be needed to operationalise the transition away from these fuels as a matter of urgency. As a major importer of fossil fuels this will be an important initiative.

The EU has made significant progress over the past four years with the European Green Deal. Prior to the EGD, in 2019 the EU’s planned policies were projected to achieve only a 33% emission reduction by 2030 below 1990 levels. With its current planned policies, it is on track to achieve a 52% reduction. In 2024 alone, the EU successfully adopted key proposals under the EGD. Some of the major accomplishments included the revisions of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, the Gas Regulation and Directive and the Methane Regulation. Positively these packages:

- Establish more ambitious mandates for renovating Europe’s buildings to be more efficient than before and signal a shift to move away from fossil fuels.
- Establish a framework for a hydrogen market, enabling the scaling up of hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of certain sectors such as industry and shipping.
- Introduce new requirements for the fossil fuel industry to monitory and report methane emission and to take appropriate mitigation measures to abate their emissions.
While these are positive steps in the right direction, many gaps and loopholes in these regulations remain and in some cases were missed opportunities to establish fossil fuel phase out and sector specific targets. To continue improving its climate action, the EU should:

- **Stop investing in additional fossil gas infrastructure and focus its efforts on the renewable energy transition.** This would also entail closing loopholes which make exceptions for fossil fuels, particularly LNG, to prevent the risk of long-term lock-in investments,
- **Agree to a full phase out fossil fuels** across all sectors, with coal phased out altogether by 2030, and fossil gas by 2035,
- **Strictly limit its dependence on carbon capture and storage** through to 2050 to only those sectors where there is no reasonable alternative to abatement at source or whole of system changes that could be deployed to eliminate CO2 emissions without the application of CCS. The EU should not allow CCS in the power sector as the sector can decarbonise completely without this technology,
- **Agree on an ambitious 2035 target** of at least 78% below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) and including fossil fuel phase-out dates,
- **Substantially increase its climate finance contributions**, including through returning revenues from the new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support decarbonisation in developing countries, and
- **Update its long-term strategy for reaching its net zero target**, especially given that the EU Commission has assessed Member States’ progress towards the EU’s climate neutrality target as insufficient.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the EU’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution and to modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, the EU should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target for 2030 to at least 62% (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) below 1990, close gaps and remove loopholes in existing policies prolonging fossil fuel use, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation.

The EU’s policies and action are also rated “Insufficient”. With the full implementation of the EU’s planned policies under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU initiatives the EU will come close to meeting its NDC target for 2030. However, not all proposals under the Fit for 55 package have been adopted. Targets and measures under available member states’ National Energy and Climate Plans are also failing to meet the EU’s targets, and half of member states have not submitted these plans. The overall lack of ambition of the EU’s 2030 NDC target will mean that it will need to adopt more rapid and deeper emission reduction measures later, in order to achieve a 1.5°C compatible pathway to climate neutrality by mid-century.

Current and planned policies will not be enough for the EU to reach its NDC target. The CAT rates the EU’s climate policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. This represents no change from the previous assessment as there have been no major new policy developments.

Since our last assessment (February 2024), the EU has adopted several proposals, such as the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. However, others are still on the table, most notably the 2040 climate targets and Energy Taxation Directive, which we consider under our updated planned policies projections.

The upper bound of our policies and action emissions projection range is based on policies reported by member states in 2023, which would result in an emissions reduction of around 43% (excl. LULUCF) below 1990 by 2030. The bottom end of the range is based on policies adopted at the EU level, including the stronger binding renewable energy target (42.5%), which would result in reducing emissions by 49% (excl. LULUCF).

Our updated planned policies projection shows the EU comes close to achieving its NDC if all its proposals under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are implemented, achieving a 51% emissions reduction from 1990. The projection includes the EU’s indicative renewable energy goal (45%) and additional measures planned.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

In October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC with a target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) - which is the same as the previous EU NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e, implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the 2030 target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are rated as “Insufficient”. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its climate finance contributions in the period post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of international fossil finance.

The EU’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share target rating, and the CAT rates the EU’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

The EU’s climate neutrality target performs moderately in terms of its architecture, transparency, and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process. At present, a finalised clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing but indicate assumptions are provided in the proposed 2040 targets but these are yet to be formalised. We evaluate the net zero target design as “Acceptable”.

**The full net zero target analysis can be found** **here.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the EU’s net zero target as: **Acceptable.**

In 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, which enshrines its collective objective of achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.”

The EU’s climate–neutrality - or, essentially, net zero GHG emissions – target is acceptable in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, with a regular review and assessment process.

There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the European Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

As required under the Climate Law, the Commission has assessed in 2023 the progress of the EU’s climate policy towards meeting its net zero target for the first time (European Commission, 2023a). The Commission found progress to be insufficient. The assessment stresses that all parts of the Fit-for-55 legislative package must be rapidly implemented and that the EU and its member states need to significantly increase the pace of emissions reductions, to almost triple the average annual reduction achieved over the last decade (European Commission, 2023a).

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The EU aims to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest, with net negative emissions thereafter.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy.
- **International aviation and maritime transport** – The target only covers international aviation. The EU has adopted policies partially covering international maritime emissions, however, this bunker is not covered in its final targets. Both international aviation and maritime emissions are not clearly mentioned in the European Climate Law.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The EU plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and will not use removals outside its borders. The European Climate Law states that the balance between emissions and removals is to be achieved domestically.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The EU passed its net zero target into law with its European Climate Law in 2021 (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2021). The net zero target is further included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020 (Croatian Presidency and the European Commission, 2020)
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The EU does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets as part of its net zero target. However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b).
- **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a). When it does so, the Commission may include proposals for amendments to the regulation. There is also a provision on the tracking of collective progress of the EU towards the achievement of net zero (Article 5), every five years.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The EU provides transparent pathways for LULUCF and separately for removals and storage. In the Commission’s impact assessment of 2040 targets, pathways for LULUCF and industrial removal across sectors are modelled between 2030 and 2050 (European Commission, 2018c, 2024b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The Climate Law has set an intermediate target of a GHG emissions reduction of 55% by 2030 (below 1990 levels). The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target. In its 2040 target communication, the commission makes reference to climate diplomacy and partnerships to encourage global decarbonisation but does not provide detail on what fair share elements it considers (European Commission, 2024c).

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The EU has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates the EU’s current policies and actions against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With its current policies in place, the EU’s emissions will reach between 2,470 and 2,755 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. This current policies pathway does not set it on track to meet its existing 2030 NDC target of 2,307 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. This represents 3–9% ambition gap. For more details on our projections, see the Assumptions tab.

To be 1.5°C compatible, current policies would need to reach at least 1,815 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

Our planned policies projections of 2,370–2,400 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) reflects the EU’s 2030 indicative renewable energy goal (of a further 2.5%, totalling 45%) as well as policy proposals that have been announced but remain to be adopted, most notably is the Energy Taxation Directive. If the EU adhered to the full list of planned policies, then it would be close to achieving its 2030 NDC target, missing the mark by 1–2%.

The full spectrum of policies proposed and adopted under the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU legislative packages have been effective in improving projected emission reductions by 2030, though some of the regulations are yet to come into effect.

Despite the enormous regulatory exercise that the EU has been pursuing, many gaps still remain, with loopholes and lax enforcement mechanisms in the policy design. Additional action is required to address these issues, including:

## Policy overview

Economy-wide emissions across the EU have continued to fall since 2019, when the new European government at the time came to power, roughly by 6% from 2019 to 2022 (the last available data point). In June 2024, European Parliament elections were held, and President von der Leyen was re-elected as head of the European Commission. The new work plan for the next Commission has signalled a shift towards framing climate action in the context of decarbonising Europe’s industries, focusing on competitiveness on a global stage and an increasing attention towards developing a new market for carbon removals.

In its previous legislative cycle (2019–2024), the European Green Deal which encapsulated the Fit-for-55 package and REPowerEU legislative packages set out a path for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Some key policies and regulations introduced and revised include the:

- Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)
- Energy Efficiency Directive
- new EU ETS II covering transport and buildings
- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
- Effort Sharing Directive
**For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here**

In the past year, the final elements of the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU packages were finalised and adopted prior to the June elections including the; Gas Regulation and Directive, Methane Regulation, Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and Carbon Removal Certification Framework, which are covered in more details for this assessment.

President von der Leyen’s plans to launch a “Clean Industrial Deal” seeking to build upon existing policies to pivot Europe’s industries. The plan focuses on scaling up manufacturing of net-zero emission technologies and investing in skilled workers to satisfy the growing domestic need for net-zero emission technologies, like electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (von der Leyen, 2024a). With this revision to existing industry related policies, the EU aims to become a global competitor with China and the US in the green technology market race. There will be a big push for expanding and improving rail networks and performance, which is a key measure needed to facilitate a modal shift to an alternative less carbon intensive mode of transport compares to airplanes and cars.


## Power sector

The EU has a binding renewable energy target of 42.5%, and an indicative target of 45% by 2030 across all sectors set by the revised Renewable Energy Directive. Under the REPowerEU package, the Commission has indicated that the EU would need to achieve 69% of renewable energy in power generation to achieve this overarching renewable target of 42.5% – 45%. Member states are expected to outline how they will achieve their share of this target in the updated NECPs which were due in June 2024. As of October 2024, only 13 have submitted their final updates.

The draft 2023 NECPs highlighted that their combined ambition was not enough to achieve the EU’s 2030 targets (European Commission, 2023b). While the renewable energy targets in the NECPs have improved, in many cases the NECPs did not include the necessary supporting measures required to achieve the targets. The final member state NECPs missing the submission deadline, and lack of concrete measures, does not instil confidence that member states will adhere to their climate commitments (Climate Action Network, 2024).

Following the June European Parliamentary elections, the incoming Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to increase investments into modernising Europe’s electricity grids over the next legislative cycle (von der Leyen, 2024a). The EU Grid Action Plan announced in November 2023 will be crucial to modernise Europe’s electricity grid to prepare it for the incoming surge of renewables and increased demand for electricity by 2030 (European Commission, 2023c). The plan will invest EUR 584 bn but lacks specific target dates for many of its actions which puts their implementation at risk (Mindekova & Cremona, 2024).


### Coal

The EU’s coal power share has been trending downward for some time and is heading in the right direction but at too slow a pace, with an average annual reduction rate of only 1.1% (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). In May 2023, coal power generation dropped to 12%, an all-time low (Ember, 2023). Overall, usage in the first half of 2023 was down by close to a quarter. To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

The EU signed up to the coal exit pledge at COP26, but did not include the coal exit as part of its 2023 NDC update. While a large majority of the EU member states either don’t use coal power or have an exit date before 2030, a handful still have later dates. As of 2024, 20 EU member states already have no coal in their electricity generation or coal power phase-out dates prior to 2030, while 6 countries have a phase out date beyond 2030 and only one country has not committed to phase out coal entirely (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). In 2023, France, Italy and Hungary delayed their coal exits but still maintain a deadline before 2030 (Beyond Fossil Fuels, 2024).

The EU bloc does not seem to fund coal projects overseas. However, some European investors have investments or shareholdings in coal projects and major coal companies across several non-EU countries including India, China, the US, Indonesia and South Africa, classified as “green”, and amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

The 2021 Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) were supposed to be a transparency framework, introduced to prevent greenwashing and promote more sustainable investing. However it has been ineffective because Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR inadequately categorise green investments. Article 8 is too broad in its sustainability scope, and Article 9 lacks consistency in defining what qualifies as a sustainable investment. The EU is now conducting an assessment on the effectiveness of this legislation (European Commission, 2024f). This presents the Commission with an opportunity to further close its policy gaps and resolve the loopholes for fossil fuel investments.


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2023, about 21% of the EU’s electricity generation came from oil and fossil gas, down by 3% compared to 2022 (Ember, 2024). To be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT finds that the EU would need to phase out fossil gas by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). While fossil gas in electricity generation is on the decline the pace is far too slow.

The EU has agreed to extend its fossil gas demand reduction target until the end of March 2024 (Council of the European Union, 2023b). Continuing to focus on cutting demand and shifting to renewable sources is a positive development. CAT analysis shows that the EU’s fossil gas strategy risks carbon lock-in and undermines global climate action.

In its efforts to move away from Russian gas following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its member states have diversified their fossil gas imports from other countries in the form of LNG. This has been accompanied by massive investment buildout in LNG terminals and gas pipelines to the tune of EUR 84 bn (Rozansk & Hassan, 2024). Consequently, Europe now has an overcapacity of LNG facilities representing long term stranded assets, further exacerbated by the decreasing demand for gas and with consumers bearing the high price of LNG (Jaller-Makarewicz, 2023). LNG imports peaked in spring 2023 and have been on the decline since.

**Revised Gas Package**

The EU recently adopted the revised Gas Directive and Regulation, intended to “shift from fossil gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen, and to establish and regulate the upcoming market for hydrogen” (European Council, 2023). Positively, it requires fossil gas distribution operators to develop plans to decommission gas networks and establishes a new and independent governance structure for the future transmission of hydrogen. This new hydrogen market is intended to prioritise the hard-to-abate sectors but the legislation fails to introduce guardrails to guarantee this. There are other concerns:

- The legislation covers low carbon gases but fails to provide a definition as to what a low carbon gaseous fuel is, risking that low carbon fuels could be derived from fossil fuels.
- Long term fossil gas supply contracts are also allowed to run until 2049.
The gas package was a missed opportunity to introduce a legally binding commitment to phase out fossil gas. The consultation process is still open for the delegated Act to define the criteria and methodology for defining low carbon gaseous fuels, representing an opportunity for the EU to strengthen any weaknesses in the gas package (Climate Action Network Europe, 2024). Needless to say that the current policy direction is still heading in the wrong direction.

There remains a mismatch between current energy needs and the time needed for all of these projects to go online, which makes them difficult to justify as low carbon alternatives when investment in energy efficiency can be brought online instead. The need for such a significant investment in fossil gas infrastructure has been countered by an assessment indicating that the EU can do without Russian gas without investing heavily into fossil fuel infrastructure (European Climate Foundation, 2022).


### Renewables

In 2023, the EU’s power sector ran on 44% of renewable sources (including biomass) (Climate Analytics, 2024). Of this, wind and solar collectively contribute to about 26% (Ember). The CAT finds that to align with 1.5°C the EU should aim to achieve at least 87% of renewables in electricity generation by 2030 and a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The deployment of wind and solar in the EU has been gaining traction in recent years, averaging 2.2% annual growth and is heading in the right direction but the pace is too slow and would need to increase to about 3.1% growth per year (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

**There have been no new policy updates since the CAT’s last assessment. For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here** .


### Nuclear energy

The EU included nuclear energy in the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), recognising it as a "strategic" technology. The NZIA supports nuclear technologies like small modular reactors, highlighting their potential to provide low-carbon energy with minimal waste, crucial for decarbonisation and energy security (European Commission, 2023d). In its 2040 climate target communication, the Commission did not specify any target or actions towards nuclear capacity build up but reaffirms nuclear a low carbon fuel needed to achieve its targets.

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with the flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.


## Industry

The EU’s industrial emissions, both energy related and from industrial processes, accounted for about 24% of its total GHG emissions in 2021 (Climate Analytics, 2024; UNFCCC, 2023). Industrial emissions have been falling on average about 2.3% per year but this is not fast enough and the EU’s industry will need to accelerate this 1.3 times faster than its current trend to reach 1.5°C compatibility (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

The EU has not signed the Beyond Oil and Gas (BOGA) declaration but eight of its member states have. Six member states — Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden — are core members of the Alliance and have committed to ending oil and fossil gas exploration and development (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021).

To decarbonise its industries, the EU introduced indicative targets in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU 2023/2413) for the share of renewables in industry. Article 22 requires the industry sectors in member states to increase the share of renewable energy by an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2021 and 2030. This annual 1.6% indicative benchmark was watered down by the Commission from the initial 1.9% growth rate it estimated it would need to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives (European Commission, 2022a).

The revised Renewable Energy Directive also requires that only 42% of incorporated hydrogen be derived from renewable energy by 2030 and 60% by 2035. This means that the industry will use a mix of renewable and fossil fuel derived hydrogen. This design will allow industries to start their shift to hydrogen but access cheaper fossil fuel derived hydrogen until the green hydrogen is available at scale and affordably. The EU does not have any provisions to fully eliminate fossil fuel derived hydrogen from industry beyond 2035, which risks the long-term dependence on fossil derived hydrogen.

**Green hydrogen**

The Commission’s Hydrogen Strategy sets out that installed capacity of electrolysers in the EU should reach 40 GW by 2030, resulting in the production of up to 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen, complemented with similar capacity installed in neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2020). The EU hydrogen policy framework has several key gaps hindering market development and does not go far enough to address issues such as high-cost entry barriers and uncertainties. At present, renewable hydrogen is also much more expensive than fossil fuel-based hydrogen. Financial support is fragmented, with a shortage of targeted funds necessary to meet the 2030 REPowerEU goals. Additionally, the EU lacks a clear definition for low-carbon hydrogen, and is only expected to develop a methodology by 2025 as part of the Delegated Act of the revised Gas Regulation.

**Developing a net zero technology Industry**

To tackle replacing industrial technology with cleaner alternatives, the EU has been developing a nexus of polices to facilitate the growth of (1) net zero technology industry and (2) industrial carbon removals, encapsulated by the:

- Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) (EU) 2024/1735, and more broadly the Green Industrial Plan
- Industrial Carbon Management Strategy
- Carbon Removal Certification Framework (proposal)
- 2040 climate targets (proposal)
In June 2024, the Net Zero Industry Act entered into force (European Parliament & European Council, 2024c). It focuses on 19 net zero technologies. It also includes the objective of developing annual injection capacity for carbon capture and storage of 50 MtCO2e by 2030 that should be used to mitigate residual emissions. These capacities should be developed by oil and fossil gas companies proportionally to their current oil and gas production levels.

The NZIA will be crucial to operationalising the direction set by the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (ICMS) (European Commission, 2024d). The ICMS lays out how it plans to scale up industrial carbon removals to deliver the EU’s climate neutrality objective, most notably from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs) and direct air carbon capture (DACC).

It sets out a target to reach 50 MtCO2e in carbon removals annually by 2030. The ICMS is strongly linked to the proposed 2040 targets, which are yet to be adopted. In its impact assessment the Commission envisions it would need about 75 MtCO2e of industrial carbon removals from BECCs and DACCs by 2040. Additionally, the Commission will create policy options and support mechanisms for industrial carbon removals, including considerations on whether and how to integrate them into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) but this is not expected until the planned revision of the ETS in 2026 (EPG, 2024).

In April 2024, the political agreement was reached on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) but is still to be adopted (Carbon Gap, 2024a; European Commission, 2022b). The CRCF seeks to establish a framework to certify the emission removals from carbon farming, carbon storage in products and industrial carbon removals (from technologies like Direct Air Carbon Capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs). The CRCF is the mechanism to deliver on the goals of the ICMS and lays out the role the CDR will play. The CRCF gives the Commission the ability to assess options for CDR and CCS targets.

The CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could go against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits.

The 2040 climate target communication keeps the role of CCS in the power sector vague under the proposed 2040 targets. This is worrying as the application of CCS to certain sectors is left open to interpretation. The incoming Commission has the opportunity during the subsequent expansion of the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and Clean Industry Deal to clearly commit to no CCS in the power sector.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to technologies which use engineered methods to capture CO2 from a source and store it geologically. CCS can be applied to a range of different CO2 sources in different sectors. CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally.

Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS doesn't remove 100% of emissions from power plants.


## Transport

Transport is the only major sector in the EU where emissions have increased over the last 30 years: emissions in 2022 followed an upward trend of 2.7% compared to 2021. It is too early to say whether emissions from the sector have peaked: the economic rebound and trend towards bigger vehicles may undermine the impact of increasing EV sales on emission levels.

The EU has introduced several policies and regulations to reduce emissions from the transport sector across all transport modes. These include but are not limited to:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413, through the adoption of sectoral renewable energy targets,
- Revised Regulation strengthening CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans (EU) 2023/851, which established a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035.
- Revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (EU) 2024/1679
- New EU ETS II which covers road transport emissions from 2027
In 2023, electric vehicle (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) made up 22% of vehicle sales. To be 1.5°C compatible in line with the Paris Agreement, the CAT finds that the EU would need to achieve 95–100% sales of light-duty electric vehicle sales by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). This is five years earlier than the EU’s current target of 2035. The EU did not sign the Zero Emissions Vehicle pledge at COP26 and did not include this target in its NDC.

In President von der Leyen’s political guidelines for the next four years in office, she hinted that the 2035 ban on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles might be watered down through the increased use of alternative fuels to achieve the ban (Mathiesen et al., 2024). The ban on fossil fuel car sales has an exemption to allow synthetic e-fuels to continue beyond 2035. Positively, the guidelines also pushes for greater improvements to the EU’s rail network to encourage a stronger modal shift towards rail (von der Leyen, 2024b).

In June 2024, the EU adopted the revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (TEN-T) (European Parliament & European Council, 2024b). The regulation intends to create the enabling conditions to scale up zero emission transport modes, improving connecting and promoting a modal shift to more share and zero mission transport.

While no new transport regulations have been adopted since the last CAT assessment in February 2024, some have been revised or are still pending agreement such as the CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicle and the Green Freight Package.

Gaps still remain for some regulations. For example, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023c) and the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 (European Parliament & European Council, 2023) consider LNG a “low carbon fuel” in shipping. As LNG is a fossil fuel, its prolonged or expanded use will make it difficult to achieve future emission reductions given the long lifetime of ships and infrastructure, resulting in stranded assets.

To reach full decarbonisation in the transport sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to increase the share of zero emission fuels (electricity, hydrogen and biofuels) from 7% in 2019 to 55% by 2030. This covers all modes of domestic transport collectively (i.e. road, rail, domestic aviation and maritime travel) (Climate Action Tracker, 2024).

**Tariffs on Chinese EVs**

In October 2024, the EU Commission announced new tariffs on battery EVs manufactured in China on the basis that the Chinese government unfairly subsidies its EVs, undercutting European car manufacturers. Individual duties will range between 17.4% to 37.6% depending on the Chinese manufacturer (European Commission, 2024e).

To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs continued exponential growth in EV sales, needs a lot of them to meet demand, and needs to make it affordable for consumers (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). One of the major barriers to this is affordability. Chinese EV models sold across EU member states are typically cheaper than European manufactured vehicles, which could affect consumer choices.


## Buildings

In 2021, buildings accounted for 13% of the EU’s total GHG emissions (Climate Analytics, 2024), consuming 40% of the EU’s final energy consumption. The buildings sector has traditionally been heavily reliant on fossil gas and oil. High energy prices triggered by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is having some impact on consumer behaviour and spurring policy action in the sector. GHG emissions in buildings have been steadily falling since 1990, but not fast enough (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a).

The main legislation driving the decarbonisation of the EU’s building sector fall under:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413
- Revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791
- Revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1275
- New EU ETS II which covers buildings sector
The revised Renewable Energy Directive sets an EU wide target to achieve 49% share of renewables in the final energy consumption in buildings by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023a). The revised Energy Efficiency Directive sets a binding target to reduce the final energy consumption by 11.7% relative to the 2020 or a target of 763 Mtoe of final energy consumption by 2030 across all sectors (European Parliament, 2023).

The EED lacks robust measures specifically targeting the building sector, focusing instead on general improvements in energy efficiency and renovation rates linked to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As of early 2024, no updated NECP submissions from member states fully comply with EED requirements, revealing a concerning lack of commitment. Furthermore, only twelve member states recognise the broader renovation obligation for public buildings (Chapelot et al., 2024), highlighting significant implementation gaps that undermine the EU's climate ambitions.

According to the reform of the EU ETS agreed in early 2023, the buildings sector will be covered by a new emissions trading scheme (EU ETS II) from 2027 onward. The requirement to purchase emission allowances to cover the sale of fossil fuels used in the transport and building sectors will further increase the incentive for home insulation and installation of clean sources of heating.

The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), adopted in 2024, includes several important measures aimed at achieving a zero emission building sectors by 2050. One of the most significant changes is the mandate that all new buildings must meet "zero emission" standards by 2030. While a step in the right direction, the proposal was watered down from the EU Commission's initial plan, which called for binding EU-level minimum energy performance standards.

While the EPBD targets a 3.5% annual renovation rate by 2030, which aligns with 1.5°C compatible benchmarks, the EU’s current renovation rate stands at only around 1% annually (Climate Action Tracker, 2020; European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). The Directive also targets the renovation of 15% of the EU's building stock by 2030, but this is widely regarded as insufficient to meet climate goals (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a). The table below provides a summary of the main targets set out in the EPBD (BPIE, 2024).

The revised EPBD missed an opportunity to fully address the issue of locking in fossil fuel heating systems, by introducing an ambiguous ban on fossil fuel boilers by 2040, while it did ban member states from subsiding the installation of fossil fuel boilers from 2025. The 2040 ban leaves the member state to decide whether or not they wish to include this in their national phase-out plans (Verplancke et al., 2024).

The implementation timeline of the revised EPBD is too slow. Key milestones, such as mandatory solar installations for new public and commercial buildings by 2027 and minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings by 2033, push essential changes far into the future. This drawn-out schedule is seen as inadequate to meet the urgent decarbonisation goals needed to address the climate crisis.

To reach full decarbonisation in the buildings sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to reduce the emission intensity (kgCO2/m2) in residential buildings and commercial buildings by 60% and 75% respectively by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. In energy saving terms, the EU would need to reduce the energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 30% and 25%, respectively, by 2030.


## Agriculture

Agriculture accounts for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions in 2021 (UNFCCC, 2023). The EU agricultural sector generates about 60% of its emissions from methane, nearly all of which come from livestock, primarily through enteric fermentation and manure management (Eurostat, 2022). Despite this, methane reduction efforts remain insufficient.

While the EU is a co-initiator of the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to cut global methane emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, only 11 member states have committed to reducing methane from livestock, covering less than 3% of the EU’s livestock units. Leaked reports indicate the EU is not on track to meet its methane reduction target, signifying the need for stronger measures (Ainger, 2022; Changing Markets, 2022). Previous Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) efforts from 2014–2020 had limited success in cutting emissions, focusing instead on increasing CO2 removals (European Union, 2022).

Early 2024 saw widespread protests by farmers against the climate and nature regulations under the Green Deal reach a fever-pitch across many member states, particularly around cutting subsidies for fossil fuels and pesticides (Dwyer, 2024). This prompted the EU to backtrack on some of its initiatives to cut emissions from agriculture under the proposed 2040 target, including on introducing sectoral targets for the first time. The Commission also rapidly passed a new regulation (EU 2024/1468) to limit some of the environmental requirements for farmers under the CAP (2023-2027), which weakened its environmental impact (European Parliament & European Council, 2024a).

The European Court of Auditors (ECA) criticised the 2023–2027 CAP strategic plans for falling short of the EU’s climate and environmental ambitions. Despite being more ambitious than previous plans, the new CAP still lacks alignment with the European Green Deal targets. The ECA recommended that the Commission promote more environmental best practices, estimate CAP’s contribution to the Green Deal, and improve its monitoring of climate and environmental outcomes (ECA, 2024).

Key to the EU achieving its 2040 targets would be the introduction of an emission reductions target for the agricultural sector combined with a levy on agricultural emission. In June 2024, Denmark took a first step in this direction by becoming the first country to introduce an agricultural carbon tax and is pushing for this to be applied at an EU level (Mooney et al., 2024) .

The influence of farmer protests were significant enough to mark a shift in the EU’s tone on regulating farmers. Critically, the EU will need to find alternative pathways in supporting farmers as they transition to decarbonise and adapt to climate impacts but continuing with exemptions risks failing to deliver on net zero by 2050.


## Forestry

Since 1990, the land use, land-use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) had constituted a sink of emissions averaging around 300 MtCO2e. However, since 2017, the sink has decreased significantly, amounting to around 230 MtCO2e in 2021.

The EU recently agreed to revisions to the LULUCF regulation (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023d), which governs the sector. It increased its 2030 target to 310 MtCO2e, up from the 225 MtCO2e limit referenced in its Climate Law. The revisions included individual targets for each member state towards the 310 MtCO2e level. While enhancing the size of the land sink is positive, it should not undermine the level of ambition in other sectors.

The EU’s incoming Carbon Removal Certification Framework will also have ramifications for emission in the forestry sector (Carbon Gap, 2024b; European Commission, 2022c). Worryingly, the CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could work against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits (EEB, 2024). **For more details on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework, see the Industry section.**

In the impact assessment for the 2040 climate targets, while not yet proposed, modelling indicated that the removals from LULUCF in 2040 could amount to somewhere between 215 MtCO2e and 376 MtCO2e with 317 MtCO2e as the central value(European Commission, 2024b). Our assessment of the EU’s proposed 2040 target indicates that the EU intends to achieve 86% emissions reductions by 2040 compared to 1990, excluding LULUCF emissions but including removals from industrial technologies such as DACCS and BECCS. This means that the EU will need to rely on expanding its LULUCF sink to achieve the remain 4–9% emission reductions. Additionally, even the largest estimated LULUCF sink of 376 MtCO2e under consideration is not sufficient to reach the 95% emission reduction.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions have continuously fallen since the mid-90s, dropping by 40% between 1990 and 2021 (European Environment Agency, 2023a).

Regulation of waste sector emissions is covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), along with those from transport, buildings, and agriculture. Combined, emissions from these sectors needs to decrease by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023e).

As of 2024, the European Parliament has voted to strengthen the proposed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles. The European Parliament's approval of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for textiles is seen as a step forward, but it lacks specific waste prevention targets and effective management strategies.

Meanwhile, the EU Council has prioritised textile reforms, neglecting critical food waste reduction measures. This approach is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, highlighting the need for stronger commitments to ensure both textile and food waste are managed effectively for sustainable outcomes (Zero Waste Europe, 2024) . The current design may not adequately incentivise producers to improve product design for longevity and recyclability, with some suggesting that the focus remains too heavily on waste management rather than preventing waste generation.


## Methane

In 2022, methane emissions accounted for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions. The majority of these emissions came from the agricultural sector, followed by waste management and energy. Methane emissions have fallen about 60% since 1990 (UNFCCC, 2024).

The EU signed the methane pledge at COP26 in 2021. Methane is covered in the overall scope of the EU’s latest NDC from 2023 but is also specifically mentioned in the context of mitigating methane emissions from maritime transport under the revised EU ETS. In 2020, the EU released its methane reduction strategy laying out its intention to cut emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste.

As part of the strategy, in 2024, the EU adopted the regulation on methane emission reduction in the energy sector (EU) 2024/1787 (European Parliament & European Council, 2024d), covering emissions from oil and fossil gas exploration, production, transmission, distribution, coal mining and imports of fossil fuels.

The regulation introduces new measures to measure, report and verify (MRV) methane emissions, methane abatement measures and a ban on routine venting and flaring. While a step in the right direction, the regulation does not go far enough – starting with the lack of an overarching methane reduction target and prolonged implementation timeline, which does not reflect the urgency and pace needed.

In addition, many exemptions and loopholes diminish the regulation's effectiveness. The regulation excludes the petrochemical sector and LNG consumption. Methane intensive LNG can be expected to grow considerably, given the signal that other EU polices are pushing. For example, the FuelEU Maritime for LNG fuel in shipping, as well as the build up of LNG infrastructure over the past few years following the shift away from imported Russian gas (Climate Action Network Europe, 2023). A recent study finds that LNG as a fuel has an emission footprint 33% greater than that of coal due to the associated methane leakage (Howarth, 2024). Additionally, despite representing the largest source of methane, the agricultural sector is not included. Instead, it is counted under the overall GHG emission reduction target for member states under the Revised Effort Sharing Directive.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions between 1990 and 2022 are based on the national inventory submitted by the EU to the UNFCCC (European Environment Agency, 2024). The data is presented in AR5 GWP values, so we convert it to AR4 GWP using gas-by-gas conversions.


## NDC and other targets

Since our last update in February 2024, the CAT has not changed its methodology for quantifying the EU’s 2030 absolute emissions target. Our current approach aligns with the EEA’s quantification of the target (European Environment Agency, 2023c). Note that the EEA’s NDC quantification includes international aviation.

- We take the EU’s 1990 emissions including LULUCF in AR5 GWP, excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation, and apply a 55% reduction to this value (European Environment Agency, 2024).
- Then we add the difference between the sink (217 MtCO2e) in 1990 and the sink of 225 MtCO2e that the EU is allowed to use towards achieving its NDC target as outlined in the European Climate Law.
- As the CAT excludes LULUCF from absolute target values, we then remove sink of 225 MtCO2e and convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.
While the LULUCF Regulation, passed in April 2023, adopts an EU-wide LULUCF sink of 310 MtCO2e, the EU has made clear that this additional sink capacity will help it exceed its 55% target and not count towards achieving it (European Parliament, 2022; European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023b). As such, we do not exclude this additional LULUCF capacity from our quantification of the target.

CO2 emissions from intra-EU flights, (as well as those departing flights to Switzerland and the United Kingdom) fall within the scope of the NDC as they are covered under the EU ETS. However, we do not consider these emissions to be part of the target quantification itself (as described above), but relevant to assessing compliance with it. As such, intra-EU CO2 aviation are not included in our NDC target calculations.


## Current policy projections

The assessment of the EU’s policy projections reflects both policies and measures implemented at the national level (the top end of our range), as well as these adopted at the EU level but not yet transposed by the Member States (the bottom end of our range).

To reflect policies adopted at the national level, we use the EEA’s compilation of national projections prepared by Member States in 2023 (European Environment Agency, 2023b). We apply the growth rate from the ‘with existing measures’ (WEM) scenario for total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) to total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) in 2022.

To calculate the bottom end of the range, we replace estimates for power CO2 emissions in the States Policies (STEPS) projections from the World Energy Outlook (WEO) with those from the Announced Pledges (APS) to account for the implementation of the 42.5% RE share in final gross consumption in the Fit for 55 package. From the Fit for 55 modelled projections, we take the MIX scenario which better reflects the current policies in place.

We then take the growth rate of this revised projection for total CO2 emissions from WEO and apply that to total GHG emission from the energy sector in 2022 and extend out to 2035. Non-CO2 emissions represent about 3% of energy sector emissions, so we think WEO is a good proxy for the entire sector. For all other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 WEM scenario to extend each sector out to 2035 individually.

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Planned policy projections

We provide a range of projections for the EU’s planned policies.

To develop a planned policies projection for the bottom of the range (i.e. maximum emission reductions), we modified our energy sector estimate to take into account the 45% indicative RE target, up from the 42.5% included in our current policy projections’ lower bound. For the other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 ‘with additional measures’ (WAM) scenario to extend each sector out to 2030 individually.

To devise the modified energy sector estimate, we took the energy emissions projections from the lower range of our current policy projection and multiplied it by the ratio between projected total energy emissions in 2030 with a 42.5% RE binding target compared to a 45% RE indicative target. We interpolated the data between total energy emissions in 2022 to this adjusted value for 2030 to complete the timeseries.

To calculate the ratio indicated above, we started with the 2030 emissions estimates provided by the European Commission in its initial modelling of the higher emissions reduction goal published in 2021 (European Commission, 2021c). We select the MIX scenario for the 2030 domestic energy related CO2 emissions (i.e. excluding international aviation and shipping). This modelling assumed a renewable energy share of 40% and when corrected to remove international bunkers, assumes a final energy consumption of 751 Mtoe.

We calculated the emissions intensity for energy CO2 emissions and then adjusted this figure to reflect the higher renewable energy share adopted by the EU (42.5% and 45%). To calculate energy CO2 emissions we used this revised emissions intensity value and the Energy Efficiency Directive’s final energy consumption target of 11.7% below the 2020 EU Reference scenario we which calculate to be 726 Mtoe, excluding international aviation in 2030.

We used the 2021 ratio between energy CO2 and all gases to estimate total emissions in 2030. For the other value in the ratio, we applied the same methods as indicated earlier but used the indicative additional target included in the Renewable Energy Directive of 2.5% (or 45% share total).

To develop a planned policies projection for the upper end of the range (i.e. minimal emission reductions), we take the projected GHG emissions under the S3 scenario from the 2040 target communication impact assessment by the European Commission (in AR5) and convert it to AR4 while at the same time removing the influence of international aviation. In the EU’s Fit for 55 modelling scenarios, international aviation is included in the final energy consumption and GHG emissions (European Commission, 2021b). To omit it, we subtract the international aviation energy consumption and GHG emissions from the totals.


## Proposed 2040 target

We take the EU’s modelled 2040 target from the S3 scenario presented in its impact assessment (European Commission, 2024b). We substitute the emissions from LULUCF in AR5 GWP and also excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation. We exclude the LULUCF emission but add in the planned assumptions for industrial carbon removals which include Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACCs) and Bioenergy Carbon Capture (BECCs). Regardless of scenario industrial removals are set at 75 MtCO2e. Finally, we convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.

This results in an emission reduction of 86% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels. We then apply the range of LULUCF assumptions (215, 317 and 376 MtCO2e) to determine the resulting emission reductions percentages from 1990. Building on the 85% baseline emission reductions, the added LULUCF options would resulting in 90%, 92% and 94% emissions reductions.


## Net-zero target

In December 2018, the European Commission published its assessment of the climate neutrality goal by 2050 for the EU28 (European Commission, 2018a, 2018c, 2018b). In 2024, as part of the EU’s 2040 target proposal’s Impact Assessment (European Commission, 2024b), new data was made available on the emission projections to 2050. Out of the four scenarios, we take the S3 scenario which best reflects the likely pathway the EU has indicated it will strive for.

We take the GHG emission in 2050 (excluding LULUCF) in AR5 and add in the assumed industrial carbon removals from DACCs and BECCs from the 2040 Target Impact Assessment. We provide a single projection and not a range based on the S3 scenario in the 2040 target impact assessment. This approach reflects what the EU Commission said it will pursue. We convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990 to get 295 MtCO2e as our target excluding LULUCF.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Some of the EU data used in our calculations is based on AR5 values. Please see the individual sections above for our conversion methods.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In October 2023, the EU submitted a revised NDC to the UNFCCC (Spain and the European Commission, 2023). Its target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e which is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target. The CAT rates this updated target as ‘did not increase ambition’ because it does not lead to a lower emissions limit (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) compared to the previous NDC.

Compared to the previous NDC update in 2020, this NDC update clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the goal.

The EU’s 2030 NDC is not close to the 1.5°C limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. It remains far behind on its fair share contribution to the 1.5°C limit and needs to substantially increase its support for emissions reductions abroad and climate finance.

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels. The CAT quantifies the 2040 target to be 660 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) or an 85% reduction from 1990. While the 2040 target does align with what would at least be needed domestically to be aligned with 1.5°C compared to modelled domestic pathways, the CAT believes that the EU should adopt at least a 95% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) by 2040 seeing as it is is failing to contribute its fair share to global climate action.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC submission from October 2023, the EU kept the same headline target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) as in its submission from December 2020 (Spain and the European Commission, 2023).

The updated NDC has increased the EU’s target for LULUCF removals to 310 MtCO2e up from 225 MtCO2e. The increase in the LULUCF sink is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target (European Parliament, 2022). However, if the EU were to use the additional 85 MtCO2e towards achieving its 2030 target – rather than the 225 MtCO2e referenced in the European Climate Law – then this would decrease the emissions reductions needed in other sectors. The CAT does not view this submission as representing an increase in ambition.

Other than the increase in the LULUCF sink, the most recent EU NDC update includes a summary of regulatory developments, and the main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed to in December 2020. It also clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the target. Based on this clarification, the CAT considers international aviation to be included in the EU’s NDC, but not international maritime emissions. Please see the Assumptions tab for more details on the quantification of the EU’s 2030 NDC.

The EU had previously submitted an update to its NDC in December 2020 (Germany & European Commission, 2020). The 2020 update provided a strengthened 2030 emissions reduction target of “at least 55%” compared to the first NDC’s target of “at least 40%” (Latvia and the European Commission, 2015). The inclusion of the land sector slightly weakens this target compared to its 2016 NDC, however, the inclusion of aviation strengthens it.

According to the Commission’s modelling reflecting the “Fit for 55” package, the EU’s emissions would amount to 2.2 GtCO2e in 2030, excluding LULUCF and international aviation[1] (European Commission, 2021a). As of the end of 2023, the EU has all the “Fit for 55” legislative framework in place to meet its “at least 55%” target. These policies still fall short of the domestic reductions needed to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Domestic emission reductions of at least 62% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) from 1990 are needed to make the EU’s effort compatible with 1.5°C, while currently the EU’s target results in a 52% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) reduction from 1990.

The EU is expected to submit an updated NDC with a target for 2035 at COP30 in 2025, but will likely folllowing the adoption of its 2040 target. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at least 74% excluding LULUCF, or a 78% reduction including LULUCF below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance. The European Commission suggests deriving the EU’s 2035 NDC from a linear trajectory between its 2030 and 2040 targets. The CAT would advocate for a non-linear trajectory based on 1.5°C compatible pathways, as delayed climate action only makes limiting warming to 1.5°C more difficult.

[1] The numbers provided in the scenario use Global Warming Potential from IPCC AR5. For the sake of comparability with other countries assessed by the Climate Action Tracker the number 2.256 MtCO2e is translated to AR4 resulting in 2.244 MtCO2e.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The EU does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

On October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC. The target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the EU’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” and is not enough to improve the EU’s fair share rating.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are higher than those of most other governments, but we still rate it “Insufficient.” The EU has committed to increasing its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel finance abroad. In its concluded negotiation position for the upcoming CO29, the EU neglects to address the need for significantly scaled-up financial support for developing countries, a key factor for enabling ambitious climate action and ensuring a fair global transition.

In 2022, the EU and its member states provided EUR 28.5 bn to developing countries (Council of the European Union, 2023a), but contributions still fall short of its fair share contribution. The EU remains committed through 2025 to the USD 100 bn collective goal of climate finance for developing countries, but the USD 100 bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period. The EU has not made clear how much its planned international climate finance contributions will be in the coming years.

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation Framework (SFDR) was established to promote transparency in sustainable investments to support informed investment decisions. However, this has failed due to broad and vague definitions of what constitute green investments. For example, European investment funds labelled as ”green” under the SFDR have been directed towards major coal firms outside the EU, including the US, China and India, amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

In February 2022, European Commission published a complementary climate-delegated act to its Taxonomy Regulation (Council of the European Union, 2022a), which states that energy generation from fossil gas and nuclear should be classified as transition activities: activities that cannot yet be replaced by low carbon alternatives but that do contribute to emissions reduction.

At COP29, the EU has reaffirmed that international public climate finance be focused on delivering on the New Collective Qualified Goal (NCQG). However, the EU has not indicated how much finance the bloc is ready to commit and has added a prerequisite to expand the number of contributors part of its position (CAN Europe, 2024).

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**New 2040 target proposed in February 2024**

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels (European Commission, 2024c). After the elections for the European Parliament, President von der Leyen reaffirmed support for the 90% target (von der Leyen, 2024a), which represents the least ambitious end of the 90-95% range initially recommended by the ESABCC (European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), 2023). Based on the assumptions in the EU’s Impact Assessment for the 2040 target (European Commission, 2024a), we quantify the target as an 85% emissions reduction from 1990 or 660 MtCO2e by 2040 (excluding LULUCF but including industrial removals from DACCs and BECCS). This means that the EU will rely on increasing its LULUCF sinks to achieve the remaining 5–10%. The EU seems unlikely to be able to achieve the upper end of the range because even with its most ambitious LULUCF sink the EU would only able to reach a 94% total emissions reduction in 2040 from 1990.

**Net zero target**

In April 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, setting into law the objective of collectively achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.” The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as agreed in the European Council’s conclusions from December 2019, has further been included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020.

The EU’s climate neutrality – or, essentially, net zero – target is “Acceptable” in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process.

At present, a clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing, although this is an element that is required of the forthcoming 2040 target. There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

**The full analysis is available** **here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated her mandate for the next four years is to continue to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal (EGD), but will focus on implementation rather than increasing ambition. The EU has made significant progress in adopting the measures of the European Green Deal bringing it closer to achieving its 2030 target, but more action is required to close the gap.**

**However, the EU is not fully on track to meet its 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% below 1990 (including** **LULUCF). The CAT therefore rates the EU’s overall climate action and current 2030 emissions reduction target as ‘Insufficient’.**

**The Commission's proposed 2040 target is a net 90% reduction in emissions below 1990, which represents the least ambitious end of the 90–95% range** **proposed** **by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC).**

**The EU does not yet have a target specifically for 2035 emission reductions. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at** **least 74% (excl. LULUCF), or a 78% reduction (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance and other support for developing countries.**

The CAT finds that the EU’s proposed 2040 target of at least 90–95% reduction (including LULUCF) results in an emissions reduction of 85% when excluding LULUCF. This emission reduction target for 2040 would be consistent with 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways. There remains an open question however as to whether or not the emission pathway of the European Union from 2030 through 2040 is 1.5° aligned as whole and that can only be assessed once the European Union has submitted the relevant targets.

The EU has signalled that it recognises the importance of scaling up international climate finance and while it has been increasing its contributions, it would need drastically increase its financial support to achieve its own commitments. Positively, the EU has worked to mobilise more private finance, through for example the EU Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to make sustainable investments more transparent. The latter is currently being assessed to address its shortfalls around its sustainability criteria.

In 2023 at COP28, the EU called for a global phase-out of “unabated” fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies not used for a just transition, however the European Union has not yet moved to establish concrete domestic phase out targets for fossil fuels which would be needed to operationalise the transition away from these fuels as a matter of urgency. As a major importer of fossil fuels this will be an important initiative.

The EU has made significant progress over the past four years with the European Green Deal. Prior to the EGD, in 2019 the EU’s planned policies were projected to achieve only a 33% emission reduction by 2030 below 1990 levels. With its current planned policies, it is on track to achieve a 52% reduction. In 2024 alone, the EU successfully adopted key proposals under the EGD. Some of the major accomplishments included the revisions of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, the Gas Regulation and Directive and the Methane Regulation. Positively these packages:

- Establish more ambitious mandates for renovating Europe’s buildings to be more efficient than before and signal a shift to move away from fossil fuels.
- Establish a framework for a hydrogen market, enabling the scaling up of hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of certain sectors such as industry and shipping.
- Introduce new requirements for the fossil fuel industry to monitory and report methane emission and to take appropriate mitigation measures to abate their emissions.
While these are positive steps in the right direction, many gaps and loopholes in these regulations remain and in some cases were missed opportunities to establish fossil fuel phase out and sector specific targets. To continue improving its climate action, the EU should:

- **Stop investing in additional fossil gas infrastructure and focus its efforts on the renewable energy transition.** This would also entail closing loopholes which make exceptions for fossil fuels, particularly LNG, to prevent the risk of long-term lock-in investments,
- **Agree to a full phase out fossil fuels** across all sectors, with coal phased out altogether by 2030, and fossil gas by 2035,
- **Strictly limit its dependence on carbon capture and storage** through to 2050 to only those sectors where there is no reasonable alternative to abatement at source or whole of system changes that could be deployed to eliminate CO2 emissions without the application of CCS. The EU should not allow CCS in the power sector as the sector can decarbonise completely without this technology,
- **Agree on an ambitious 2035 target** of at least 78% below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) and including fossil fuel phase-out dates,
- **Substantially increase its climate finance contributions**, including through returning revenues from the new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support decarbonisation in developing countries, and
- **Update its long-term strategy for reaching its net zero target**, especially given that the EU Commission has assessed Member States’ progress towards the EU’s climate neutrality target as insufficient.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the EU’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution and to modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, the EU should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target for 2030 to at least 62% (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) below 1990, close gaps and remove loopholes in existing policies prolonging fossil fuel use, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation.

The EU’s policies and action are also rated “Insufficient”. With the full implementation of the EU’s planned policies under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU initiatives the EU will come close to meeting its NDC target for 2030. However, not all proposals under the Fit for 55 package have been adopted. Targets and measures under available member states’ National Energy and Climate Plans are also failing to meet the EU’s targets, and half of member states have not submitted these plans. The overall lack of ambition of the EU’s 2030 NDC target will mean that it will need to adopt more rapid and deeper emission reduction measures later, in order to achieve a 1.5°C compatible pathway to climate neutrality by mid-century.

Current and planned policies will not be enough for the EU to reach its NDC target. The CAT rates the EU’s climate policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. This represents no change from the previous assessment as there have been no major new policy developments.

Since our last assessment (February 2024), the EU has adopted several proposals, such as the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. However, others are still on the table, most notably the 2040 climate targets and Energy Taxation Directive, which we consider under our updated planned policies projections.

The upper bound of our policies and action emissions projection range is based on policies reported by member states in 2023, which would result in an emissions reduction of around 43% (excl. LULUCF) below 1990 by 2030. The bottom end of the range is based on policies adopted at the EU level, including the stronger binding renewable energy target (42.5%), which would result in reducing emissions by 49% (excl. LULUCF).

Our updated planned policies projection shows the EU comes close to achieving its NDC if all its proposals under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are implemented, achieving a 51% emissions reduction from 1990. The projection includes the EU’s indicative renewable energy goal (45%) and additional measures planned.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

In October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC with a target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) - which is the same as the previous EU NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e, implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the 2030 target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are rated as “Insufficient”. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its climate finance contributions in the period post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of international fossil finance.

The EU’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share target rating, and the CAT rates the EU’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

The EU’s climate neutrality target performs moderately in terms of its architecture, transparency, and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process. At present, a finalised clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing but indicate assumptions are provided in the proposed 2040 targets but these are yet to be formalised. We evaluate the net zero target design as “Acceptable”.

**The full net zero target analysis can be found** **here.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the EU’s net zero target as: **Acceptable.**

In 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, which enshrines its collective objective of achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.”

The EU’s climate–neutrality - or, essentially, net zero GHG emissions – target is acceptable in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, with a regular review and assessment process.

There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the European Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

As required under the Climate Law, the Commission has assessed in 2023 the progress of the EU’s climate policy towards meeting its net zero target for the first time (European Commission, 2023a). The Commission found progress to be insufficient. The assessment stresses that all parts of the Fit-for-55 legislative package must be rapidly implemented and that the EU and its member states need to significantly increase the pace of emissions reductions, to almost triple the average annual reduction achieved over the last decade (European Commission, 2023a).

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The EU aims to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest, with net negative emissions thereafter.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy.
- **International aviation and maritime transport** – The target only covers international aviation. The EU has adopted policies partially covering international maritime emissions, however, this bunker is not covered in its final targets. Both international aviation and maritime emissions are not clearly mentioned in the European Climate Law.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The EU plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and will not use removals outside its borders. The European Climate Law states that the balance between emissions and removals is to be achieved domestically.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The EU passed its net zero target into law with its European Climate Law in 2021 (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2021). The net zero target is further included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020 (Croatian Presidency and the European Commission, 2020)
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The EU does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets as part of its net zero target. However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b).
- **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a). When it does so, the Commission may include proposals for amendments to the regulation. There is also a provision on the tracking of collective progress of the EU towards the achievement of net zero (Article 5), every five years.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The EU provides transparent pathways for LULUCF and separately for removals and storage. In the Commission’s impact assessment of 2040 targets, pathways for LULUCF and industrial removal across sectors are modelled between 2030 and 2050 (European Commission, 2018c, 2024b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The Climate Law has set an intermediate target of a GHG emissions reduction of 55% by 2030 (below 1990 levels). The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target. In its 2040 target communication, the commission makes reference to climate diplomacy and partnerships to encourage global decarbonisation but does not provide detail on what fair share elements it considers (European Commission, 2024c).

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The EU has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates the EU’s current policies and actions against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With its current policies in place, the EU’s emissions will reach between 2,470 and 2,755 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. This current policies pathway does not set it on track to meet its existing 2030 NDC target of 2,307 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. This represents 3–9% ambition gap. For more details on our projections, see the Assumptions tab.

To be 1.5°C compatible, current policies would need to reach at least 1,815 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

Our planned policies projections of 2,370–2,400 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) reflects the EU’s 2030 indicative renewable energy goal (of a further 2.5%, totalling 45%) as well as policy proposals that have been announced but remain to be adopted, most notably is the Energy Taxation Directive. If the EU adhered to the full list of planned policies, then it would be close to achieving its 2030 NDC target, missing the mark by 1–2%.

The full spectrum of policies proposed and adopted under the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU legislative packages have been effective in improving projected emission reductions by 2030, though some of the regulations are yet to come into effect.

Despite the enormous regulatory exercise that the EU has been pursuing, many gaps still remain, with loopholes and lax enforcement mechanisms in the policy design. Additional action is required to address these issues, including:

## Policy overview

Economy-wide emissions across the EU have continued to fall since 2019, when the new European government at the time came to power, roughly by 6% from 2019 to 2022 (the last available data point). In June 2024, European Parliament elections were held, and President von der Leyen was re-elected as head of the European Commission. The new work plan for the next Commission has signalled a shift towards framing climate action in the context of decarbonising Europe’s industries, focusing on competitiveness on a global stage and an increasing attention towards developing a new market for carbon removals.

In its previous legislative cycle (2019–2024), the European Green Deal which encapsulated the Fit-for-55 package and REPowerEU legislative packages set out a path for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Some key policies and regulations introduced and revised include the:

- Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)
- Energy Efficiency Directive
- new EU ETS II covering transport and buildings
- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
- Effort Sharing Directive
**For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here**

In the past year, the final elements of the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU packages were finalised and adopted prior to the June elections including the; Gas Regulation and Directive, Methane Regulation, Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and Carbon Removal Certification Framework, which are covered in more details for this assessment.

President von der Leyen’s plans to launch a “Clean Industrial Deal” seeking to build upon existing policies to pivot Europe’s industries. The plan focuses on scaling up manufacturing of net-zero emission technologies and investing in skilled workers to satisfy the growing domestic need for net-zero emission technologies, like electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (von der Leyen, 2024a). With this revision to existing industry related policies, the EU aims to become a global competitor with China and the US in the green technology market race. There will be a big push for expanding and improving rail networks and performance, which is a key measure needed to facilitate a modal shift to an alternative less carbon intensive mode of transport compares to airplanes and cars.


## Power sector

The EU has a binding renewable energy target of 42.5%, and an indicative target of 45% by 2030 across all sectors set by the revised Renewable Energy Directive. Under the REPowerEU package, the Commission has indicated that the EU would need to achieve 69% of renewable energy in power generation to achieve this overarching renewable target of 42.5% – 45%. Member states are expected to outline how they will achieve their share of this target in the updated NECPs which were due in June 2024. As of October 2024, only 13 have submitted their final updates.

The draft 2023 NECPs highlighted that their combined ambition was not enough to achieve the EU’s 2030 targets (European Commission, 2023b). While the renewable energy targets in the NECPs have improved, in many cases the NECPs did not include the necessary supporting measures required to achieve the targets. The final member state NECPs missing the submission deadline, and lack of concrete measures, does not instil confidence that member states will adhere to their climate commitments (Climate Action Network, 2024).

Following the June European Parliamentary elections, the incoming Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to increase investments into modernising Europe’s electricity grids over the next legislative cycle (von der Leyen, 2024a). The EU Grid Action Plan announced in November 2023 will be crucial to modernise Europe’s electricity grid to prepare it for the incoming surge of renewables and increased demand for electricity by 2030 (European Commission, 2023c). The plan will invest EUR 584 bn but lacks specific target dates for many of its actions which puts their implementation at risk (Mindekova & Cremona, 2024).


### Coal

The EU’s coal power share has been trending downward for some time and is heading in the right direction but at too slow a pace, with an average annual reduction rate of only 1.1% (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). In May 2023, coal power generation dropped to 12%, an all-time low (Ember, 2023). Overall, usage in the first half of 2023 was down by close to a quarter. To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

The EU signed up to the coal exit pledge at COP26, but did not include the coal exit as part of its 2023 NDC update. While a large majority of the EU member states either don’t use coal power or have an exit date before 2030, a handful still have later dates. As of 2024, 20 EU member states already have no coal in their electricity generation or coal power phase-out dates prior to 2030, while 6 countries have a phase out date beyond 2030 and only one country has not committed to phase out coal entirely (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). In 2023, France, Italy and Hungary delayed their coal exits but still maintain a deadline before 2030 (Beyond Fossil Fuels, 2024).

The EU bloc does not seem to fund coal projects overseas. However, some European investors have investments or shareholdings in coal projects and major coal companies across several non-EU countries including India, China, the US, Indonesia and South Africa, classified as “green”, and amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

The 2021 Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) were supposed to be a transparency framework, introduced to prevent greenwashing and promote more sustainable investing. However it has been ineffective because Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR inadequately categorise green investments. Article 8 is too broad in its sustainability scope, and Article 9 lacks consistency in defining what qualifies as a sustainable investment. The EU is now conducting an assessment on the effectiveness of this legislation (European Commission, 2024f). This presents the Commission with an opportunity to further close its policy gaps and resolve the loopholes for fossil fuel investments.


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2023, about 21% of the EU’s electricity generation came from oil and fossil gas, down by 3% compared to 2022 (Ember, 2024). To be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT finds that the EU would need to phase out fossil gas by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). While fossil gas in electricity generation is on the decline the pace is far too slow.

The EU has agreed to extend its fossil gas demand reduction target until the end of March 2024 (Council of the European Union, 2023b). Continuing to focus on cutting demand and shifting to renewable sources is a positive development. CAT analysis shows that the EU’s fossil gas strategy risks carbon lock-in and undermines global climate action.

In its efforts to move away from Russian gas following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its member states have diversified their fossil gas imports from other countries in the form of LNG. This has been accompanied by massive investment buildout in LNG terminals and gas pipelines to the tune of EUR 84 bn (Rozansk & Hassan, 2024). Consequently, Europe now has an overcapacity of LNG facilities representing long term stranded assets, further exacerbated by the decreasing demand for gas and with consumers bearing the high price of LNG (Jaller-Makarewicz, 2023). LNG imports peaked in spring 2023 and have been on the decline since.

**Revised Gas Package**

The EU recently adopted the revised Gas Directive and Regulation, intended to “shift from fossil gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen, and to establish and regulate the upcoming market for hydrogen” (European Council, 2023). Positively, it requires fossil gas distribution operators to develop plans to decommission gas networks and establishes a new and independent governance structure for the future transmission of hydrogen. This new hydrogen market is intended to prioritise the hard-to-abate sectors but the legislation fails to introduce guardrails to guarantee this. There are other concerns:

- The legislation covers low carbon gases but fails to provide a definition as to what a low carbon gaseous fuel is, risking that low carbon fuels could be derived from fossil fuels.
- Long term fossil gas supply contracts are also allowed to run until 2049.
The gas package was a missed opportunity to introduce a legally binding commitment to phase out fossil gas. The consultation process is still open for the delegated Act to define the criteria and methodology for defining low carbon gaseous fuels, representing an opportunity for the EU to strengthen any weaknesses in the gas package (Climate Action Network Europe, 2024). Needless to say that the current policy direction is still heading in the wrong direction.

There remains a mismatch between current energy needs and the time needed for all of these projects to go online, which makes them difficult to justify as low carbon alternatives when investment in energy efficiency can be brought online instead. The need for such a significant investment in fossil gas infrastructure has been countered by an assessment indicating that the EU can do without Russian gas without investing heavily into fossil fuel infrastructure (European Climate Foundation, 2022).


### Renewables

In 2023, the EU’s power sector ran on 44% of renewable sources (including biomass) (Climate Analytics, 2024). Of this, wind and solar collectively contribute to about 26% (Ember). The CAT finds that to align with 1.5°C the EU should aim to achieve at least 87% of renewables in electricity generation by 2030 and a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The deployment of wind and solar in the EU has been gaining traction in recent years, averaging 2.2% annual growth and is heading in the right direction but the pace is too slow and would need to increase to about 3.1% growth per year (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

**There have been no new policy updates since the CAT’s last assessment. For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here** .


### Nuclear energy

The EU included nuclear energy in the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), recognising it as a "strategic" technology. The NZIA supports nuclear technologies like small modular reactors, highlighting their potential to provide low-carbon energy with minimal waste, crucial for decarbonisation and energy security (European Commission, 2023d). In its 2040 climate target communication, the Commission did not specify any target or actions towards nuclear capacity build up but reaffirms nuclear a low carbon fuel needed to achieve its targets.

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with the flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.


## Industry

The EU’s industrial emissions, both energy related and from industrial processes, accounted for about 24% of its total GHG emissions in 2021 (Climate Analytics, 2024; UNFCCC, 2023). Industrial emissions have been falling on average about 2.3% per year but this is not fast enough and the EU’s industry will need to accelerate this 1.3 times faster than its current trend to reach 1.5°C compatibility (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

The EU has not signed the Beyond Oil and Gas (BOGA) declaration but eight of its member states have. Six member states — Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden — are core members of the Alliance and have committed to ending oil and fossil gas exploration and development (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021).

To decarbonise its industries, the EU introduced indicative targets in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU 2023/2413) for the share of renewables in industry. Article 22 requires the industry sectors in member states to increase the share of renewable energy by an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2021 and 2030. This annual 1.6% indicative benchmark was watered down by the Commission from the initial 1.9% growth rate it estimated it would need to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives (European Commission, 2022a).

The revised Renewable Energy Directive also requires that only 42% of incorporated hydrogen be derived from renewable energy by 2030 and 60% by 2035. This means that the industry will use a mix of renewable and fossil fuel derived hydrogen. This design will allow industries to start their shift to hydrogen but access cheaper fossil fuel derived hydrogen until the green hydrogen is available at scale and affordably. The EU does not have any provisions to fully eliminate fossil fuel derived hydrogen from industry beyond 2035, which risks the long-term dependence on fossil derived hydrogen.

**Green hydrogen**

The Commission’s Hydrogen Strategy sets out that installed capacity of electrolysers in the EU should reach 40 GW by 2030, resulting in the production of up to 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen, complemented with similar capacity installed in neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2020). The EU hydrogen policy framework has several key gaps hindering market development and does not go far enough to address issues such as high-cost entry barriers and uncertainties. At present, renewable hydrogen is also much more expensive than fossil fuel-based hydrogen. Financial support is fragmented, with a shortage of targeted funds necessary to meet the 2030 REPowerEU goals. Additionally, the EU lacks a clear definition for low-carbon hydrogen, and is only expected to develop a methodology by 2025 as part of the Delegated Act of the revised Gas Regulation.

**Developing a net zero technology Industry**

To tackle replacing industrial technology with cleaner alternatives, the EU has been developing a nexus of polices to facilitate the growth of (1) net zero technology industry and (2) industrial carbon removals, encapsulated by the:

- Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) (EU) 2024/1735, and more broadly the Green Industrial Plan
- Industrial Carbon Management Strategy
- Carbon Removal Certification Framework (proposal)
- 2040 climate targets (proposal)
In June 2024, the Net Zero Industry Act entered into force (European Parliament & European Council, 2024c). It focuses on 19 net zero technologies. It also includes the objective of developing annual injection capacity for carbon capture and storage of 50 MtCO2e by 2030 that should be used to mitigate residual emissions. These capacities should be developed by oil and fossil gas companies proportionally to their current oil and gas production levels.

The NZIA will be crucial to operationalising the direction set by the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (ICMS) (European Commission, 2024d). The ICMS lays out how it plans to scale up industrial carbon removals to deliver the EU’s climate neutrality objective, most notably from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs) and direct air carbon capture (DACC).

It sets out a target to reach 50 MtCO2e in carbon removals annually by 2030. The ICMS is strongly linked to the proposed 2040 targets, which are yet to be adopted. In its impact assessment the Commission envisions it would need about 75 MtCO2e of industrial carbon removals from BECCs and DACCs by 2040. Additionally, the Commission will create policy options and support mechanisms for industrial carbon removals, including considerations on whether and how to integrate them into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) but this is not expected until the planned revision of the ETS in 2026 (EPG, 2024).

In April 2024, the political agreement was reached on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) but is still to be adopted (Carbon Gap, 2024a; European Commission, 2022b). The CRCF seeks to establish a framework to certify the emission removals from carbon farming, carbon storage in products and industrial carbon removals (from technologies like Direct Air Carbon Capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs). The CRCF is the mechanism to deliver on the goals of the ICMS and lays out the role the CDR will play. The CRCF gives the Commission the ability to assess options for CDR and CCS targets.

The CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could go against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits.

The 2040 climate target communication keeps the role of CCS in the power sector vague under the proposed 2040 targets. This is worrying as the application of CCS to certain sectors is left open to interpretation. The incoming Commission has the opportunity during the subsequent expansion of the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and Clean Industry Deal to clearly commit to no CCS in the power sector.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to technologies which use engineered methods to capture CO2 from a source and store it geologically. CCS can be applied to a range of different CO2 sources in different sectors. CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally.

Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS doesn't remove 100% of emissions from power plants.


## Transport

Transport is the only major sector in the EU where emissions have increased over the last 30 years: emissions in 2022 followed an upward trend of 2.7% compared to 2021. It is too early to say whether emissions from the sector have peaked: the economic rebound and trend towards bigger vehicles may undermine the impact of increasing EV sales on emission levels.

The EU has introduced several policies and regulations to reduce emissions from the transport sector across all transport modes. These include but are not limited to:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413, through the adoption of sectoral renewable energy targets,
- Revised Regulation strengthening CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans (EU) 2023/851, which established a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035.
- Revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (EU) 2024/1679
- New EU ETS II which covers road transport emissions from 2027
In 2023, electric vehicle (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) made up 22% of vehicle sales. To be 1.5°C compatible in line with the Paris Agreement, the CAT finds that the EU would need to achieve 95–100% sales of light-duty electric vehicle sales by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). This is five years earlier than the EU’s current target of 2035. The EU did not sign the Zero Emissions Vehicle pledge at COP26 and did not include this target in its NDC.

In President von der Leyen’s political guidelines for the next four years in office, she hinted that the 2035 ban on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles might be watered down through the increased use of alternative fuels to achieve the ban (Mathiesen et al., 2024). The ban on fossil fuel car sales has an exemption to allow synthetic e-fuels to continue beyond 2035. Positively, the guidelines also pushes for greater improvements to the EU’s rail network to encourage a stronger modal shift towards rail (von der Leyen, 2024b).

In June 2024, the EU adopted the revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (TEN-T) (European Parliament & European Council, 2024b). The regulation intends to create the enabling conditions to scale up zero emission transport modes, improving connecting and promoting a modal shift to more share and zero mission transport.

While no new transport regulations have been adopted since the last CAT assessment in February 2024, some have been revised or are still pending agreement such as the CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicle and the Green Freight Package.

Gaps still remain for some regulations. For example, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023c) and the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 (European Parliament & European Council, 2023) consider LNG a “low carbon fuel” in shipping. As LNG is a fossil fuel, its prolonged or expanded use will make it difficult to achieve future emission reductions given the long lifetime of ships and infrastructure, resulting in stranded assets.

To reach full decarbonisation in the transport sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to increase the share of zero emission fuels (electricity, hydrogen and biofuels) from 7% in 2019 to 55% by 2030. This covers all modes of domestic transport collectively (i.e. road, rail, domestic aviation and maritime travel) (Climate Action Tracker, 2024).

**Tariffs on Chinese EVs**

In October 2024, the EU Commission announced new tariffs on battery EVs manufactured in China on the basis that the Chinese government unfairly subsidies its EVs, undercutting European car manufacturers. Individual duties will range between 17.4% to 37.6% depending on the Chinese manufacturer (European Commission, 2024e).

To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs continued exponential growth in EV sales, needs a lot of them to meet demand, and needs to make it affordable for consumers (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). One of the major barriers to this is affordability. Chinese EV models sold across EU member states are typically cheaper than European manufactured vehicles, which could affect consumer choices.


## Buildings

In 2021, buildings accounted for 13% of the EU’s total GHG emissions (Climate Analytics, 2024), consuming 40% of the EU’s final energy consumption. The buildings sector has traditionally been heavily reliant on fossil gas and oil. High energy prices triggered by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is having some impact on consumer behaviour and spurring policy action in the sector. GHG emissions in buildings have been steadily falling since 1990, but not fast enough (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a).

The main legislation driving the decarbonisation of the EU’s building sector fall under:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413
- Revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791
- Revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1275
- New EU ETS II which covers buildings sector
The revised Renewable Energy Directive sets an EU wide target to achieve 49% share of renewables in the final energy consumption in buildings by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023a). The revised Energy Efficiency Directive sets a binding target to reduce the final energy consumption by 11.7% relative to the 2020 or a target of 763 Mtoe of final energy consumption by 2030 across all sectors (European Parliament, 2023).

The EED lacks robust measures specifically targeting the building sector, focusing instead on general improvements in energy efficiency and renovation rates linked to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As of early 2024, no updated NECP submissions from member states fully comply with EED requirements, revealing a concerning lack of commitment. Furthermore, only twelve member states recognise the broader renovation obligation for public buildings (Chapelot et al., 2024), highlighting significant implementation gaps that undermine the EU's climate ambitions.

According to the reform of the EU ETS agreed in early 2023, the buildings sector will be covered by a new emissions trading scheme (EU ETS II) from 2027 onward. The requirement to purchase emission allowances to cover the sale of fossil fuels used in the transport and building sectors will further increase the incentive for home insulation and installation of clean sources of heating.

The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), adopted in 2024, includes several important measures aimed at achieving a zero emission building sectors by 2050. One of the most significant changes is the mandate that all new buildings must meet "zero emission" standards by 2030. While a step in the right direction, the proposal was watered down from the EU Commission's initial plan, which called for binding EU-level minimum energy performance standards.

While the EPBD targets a 3.5% annual renovation rate by 2030, which aligns with 1.5°C compatible benchmarks, the EU’s current renovation rate stands at only around 1% annually (Climate Action Tracker, 2020; European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). The Directive also targets the renovation of 15% of the EU's building stock by 2030, but this is widely regarded as insufficient to meet climate goals (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a). The table below provides a summary of the main targets set out in the EPBD (BPIE, 2024).

The revised EPBD missed an opportunity to fully address the issue of locking in fossil fuel heating systems, by introducing an ambiguous ban on fossil fuel boilers by 2040, while it did ban member states from subsiding the installation of fossil fuel boilers from 2025. The 2040 ban leaves the member state to decide whether or not they wish to include this in their national phase-out plans (Verplancke et al., 2024).

The implementation timeline of the revised EPBD is too slow. Key milestones, such as mandatory solar installations for new public and commercial buildings by 2027 and minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings by 2033, push essential changes far into the future. This drawn-out schedule is seen as inadequate to meet the urgent decarbonisation goals needed to address the climate crisis.

To reach full decarbonisation in the buildings sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to reduce the emission intensity (kgCO2/m2) in residential buildings and commercial buildings by 60% and 75% respectively by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. In energy saving terms, the EU would need to reduce the energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 30% and 25%, respectively, by 2030.


## Agriculture

Agriculture accounts for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions in 2021 (UNFCCC, 2023). The EU agricultural sector generates about 60% of its emissions from methane, nearly all of which come from livestock, primarily through enteric fermentation and manure management (Eurostat, 2022). Despite this, methane reduction efforts remain insufficient.

While the EU is a co-initiator of the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to cut global methane emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, only 11 member states have committed to reducing methane from livestock, covering less than 3% of the EU’s livestock units. Leaked reports indicate the EU is not on track to meet its methane reduction target, signifying the need for stronger measures (Ainger, 2022; Changing Markets, 2022). Previous Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) efforts from 2014–2020 had limited success in cutting emissions, focusing instead on increasing CO2 removals (European Union, 2022).

Early 2024 saw widespread protests by farmers against the climate and nature regulations under the Green Deal reach a fever-pitch across many member states, particularly around cutting subsidies for fossil fuels and pesticides (Dwyer, 2024). This prompted the EU to backtrack on some of its initiatives to cut emissions from agriculture under the proposed 2040 target, including on introducing sectoral targets for the first time. The Commission also rapidly passed a new regulation (EU 2024/1468) to limit some of the environmental requirements for farmers under the CAP (2023-2027), which weakened its environmental impact (European Parliament & European Council, 2024a).

The European Court of Auditors (ECA) criticised the 2023–2027 CAP strategic plans for falling short of the EU’s climate and environmental ambitions. Despite being more ambitious than previous plans, the new CAP still lacks alignment with the European Green Deal targets. The ECA recommended that the Commission promote more environmental best practices, estimate CAP’s contribution to the Green Deal, and improve its monitoring of climate and environmental outcomes (ECA, 2024).

Key to the EU achieving its 2040 targets would be the introduction of an emission reductions target for the agricultural sector combined with a levy on agricultural emission. In June 2024, Denmark took a first step in this direction by becoming the first country to introduce an agricultural carbon tax and is pushing for this to be applied at an EU level (Mooney et al., 2024) .

The influence of farmer protests were significant enough to mark a shift in the EU’s tone on regulating farmers. Critically, the EU will need to find alternative pathways in supporting farmers as they transition to decarbonise and adapt to climate impacts but continuing with exemptions risks failing to deliver on net zero by 2050.


## Forestry

Since 1990, the land use, land-use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) had constituted a sink of emissions averaging around 300 MtCO2e. However, since 2017, the sink has decreased significantly, amounting to around 230 MtCO2e in 2021.

The EU recently agreed to revisions to the LULUCF regulation (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023d), which governs the sector. It increased its 2030 target to 310 MtCO2e, up from the 225 MtCO2e limit referenced in its Climate Law. The revisions included individual targets for each member state towards the 310 MtCO2e level. While enhancing the size of the land sink is positive, it should not undermine the level of ambition in other sectors.

The EU’s incoming Carbon Removal Certification Framework will also have ramifications for emission in the forestry sector (Carbon Gap, 2024b; European Commission, 2022c). Worryingly, the CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could work against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits (EEB, 2024). **For more details on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework, see the Industry section.**

In the impact assessment for the 2040 climate targets, while not yet proposed, modelling indicated that the removals from LULUCF in 2040 could amount to somewhere between 215 MtCO2e and 376 MtCO2e with 317 MtCO2e as the central value(European Commission, 2024b). Our assessment of the EU’s proposed 2040 target indicates that the EU intends to achieve 86% emissions reductions by 2040 compared to 1990, excluding LULUCF emissions but including removals from industrial technologies such as DACCS and BECCS. This means that the EU will need to rely on expanding its LULUCF sink to achieve the remain 4–9% emission reductions. Additionally, even the largest estimated LULUCF sink of 376 MtCO2e under consideration is not sufficient to reach the 95% emission reduction.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions have continuously fallen since the mid-90s, dropping by 40% between 1990 and 2021 (European Environment Agency, 2023a).

Regulation of waste sector emissions is covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), along with those from transport, buildings, and agriculture. Combined, emissions from these sectors needs to decrease by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023e).

As of 2024, the European Parliament has voted to strengthen the proposed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles. The European Parliament's approval of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for textiles is seen as a step forward, but it lacks specific waste prevention targets and effective management strategies.

Meanwhile, the EU Council has prioritised textile reforms, neglecting critical food waste reduction measures. This approach is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, highlighting the need for stronger commitments to ensure both textile and food waste are managed effectively for sustainable outcomes (Zero Waste Europe, 2024) . The current design may not adequately incentivise producers to improve product design for longevity and recyclability, with some suggesting that the focus remains too heavily on waste management rather than preventing waste generation.


## Methane

In 2022, methane emissions accounted for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions. The majority of these emissions came from the agricultural sector, followed by waste management and energy. Methane emissions have fallen about 60% since 1990 (UNFCCC, 2024).

The EU signed the methane pledge at COP26 in 2021. Methane is covered in the overall scope of the EU’s latest NDC from 2023 but is also specifically mentioned in the context of mitigating methane emissions from maritime transport under the revised EU ETS. In 2020, the EU released its methane reduction strategy laying out its intention to cut emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste.

As part of the strategy, in 2024, the EU adopted the regulation on methane emission reduction in the energy sector (EU) 2024/1787 (European Parliament & European Council, 2024d), covering emissions from oil and fossil gas exploration, production, transmission, distribution, coal mining and imports of fossil fuels.

The regulation introduces new measures to measure, report and verify (MRV) methane emissions, methane abatement measures and a ban on routine venting and flaring. While a step in the right direction, the regulation does not go far enough – starting with the lack of an overarching methane reduction target and prolonged implementation timeline, which does not reflect the urgency and pace needed.

In addition, many exemptions and loopholes diminish the regulation's effectiveness. The regulation excludes the petrochemical sector and LNG consumption. Methane intensive LNG can be expected to grow considerably, given the signal that other EU polices are pushing. For example, the FuelEU Maritime for LNG fuel in shipping, as well as the build up of LNG infrastructure over the past few years following the shift away from imported Russian gas (Climate Action Network Europe, 2023). A recent study finds that LNG as a fuel has an emission footprint 33% greater than that of coal due to the associated methane leakage (Howarth, 2024). Additionally, despite representing the largest source of methane, the agricultural sector is not included. Instead, it is counted under the overall GHG emission reduction target for member states under the Revised Effort Sharing Directive.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions between 1990 and 2022 are based on the national inventory submitted by the EU to the UNFCCC (European Environment Agency, 2024). The data is presented in AR5 GWP values, so we convert it to AR4 GWP using gas-by-gas conversions.


## NDC and other targets

Since our last update in February 2024, the CAT has not changed its methodology for quantifying the EU’s 2030 absolute emissions target. Our current approach aligns with the EEA’s quantification of the target (European Environment Agency, 2023c). Note that the EEA’s NDC quantification includes international aviation.

- We take the EU’s 1990 emissions including LULUCF in AR5 GWP, excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation, and apply a 55% reduction to this value (European Environment Agency, 2024).
- Then we add the difference between the sink (217 MtCO2e) in 1990 and the sink of 225 MtCO2e that the EU is allowed to use towards achieving its NDC target as outlined in the European Climate Law.
- As the CAT excludes LULUCF from absolute target values, we then remove sink of 225 MtCO2e and convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.
While the LULUCF Regulation, passed in April 2023, adopts an EU-wide LULUCF sink of 310 MtCO2e, the EU has made clear that this additional sink capacity will help it exceed its 55% target and not count towards achieving it (European Parliament, 2022; European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023b). As such, we do not exclude this additional LULUCF capacity from our quantification of the target.

CO2 emissions from intra-EU flights, (as well as those departing flights to Switzerland and the United Kingdom) fall within the scope of the NDC as they are covered under the EU ETS. However, we do not consider these emissions to be part of the target quantification itself (as described above), but relevant to assessing compliance with it. As such, intra-EU CO2 aviation are not included in our NDC target calculations.


## Current policy projections

The assessment of the EU’s policy projections reflects both policies and measures implemented at the national level (the top end of our range), as well as these adopted at the EU level but not yet transposed by the Member States (the bottom end of our range).

To reflect policies adopted at the national level, we use the EEA’s compilation of national projections prepared by Member States in 2023 (European Environment Agency, 2023b). We apply the growth rate from the ‘with existing measures’ (WEM) scenario for total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) to total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) in 2022.

To calculate the bottom end of the range, we replace estimates for power CO2 emissions in the States Policies (STEPS) projections from the World Energy Outlook (WEO) with those from the Announced Pledges (APS) to account for the implementation of the 42.5% RE share in final gross consumption in the Fit for 55 package. From the Fit for 55 modelled projections, we take the MIX scenario which better reflects the current policies in place.

We then take the growth rate of this revised projection for total CO2 emissions from WEO and apply that to total GHG emission from the energy sector in 2022 and extend out to 2035. Non-CO2 emissions represent about 3% of energy sector emissions, so we think WEO is a good proxy for the entire sector. For all other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 WEM scenario to extend each sector out to 2035 individually.

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Planned policy projections

We provide a range of projections for the EU’s planned policies.

To develop a planned policies projection for the bottom of the range (i.e. maximum emission reductions), we modified our energy sector estimate to take into account the 45% indicative RE target, up from the 42.5% included in our current policy projections’ lower bound. For the other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 ‘with additional measures’ (WAM) scenario to extend each sector out to 2030 individually.

To devise the modified energy sector estimate, we took the energy emissions projections from the lower range of our current policy projection and multiplied it by the ratio between projected total energy emissions in 2030 with a 42.5% RE binding target compared to a 45% RE indicative target. We interpolated the data between total energy emissions in 2022 to this adjusted value for 2030 to complete the timeseries.

To calculate the ratio indicated above, we started with the 2030 emissions estimates provided by the European Commission in its initial modelling of the higher emissions reduction goal published in 2021 (European Commission, 2021c). We select the MIX scenario for the 2030 domestic energy related CO2 emissions (i.e. excluding international aviation and shipping). This modelling assumed a renewable energy share of 40% and when corrected to remove international bunkers, assumes a final energy consumption of 751 Mtoe.

We calculated the emissions intensity for energy CO2 emissions and then adjusted this figure to reflect the higher renewable energy share adopted by the EU (42.5% and 45%). To calculate energy CO2 emissions we used this revised emissions intensity value and the Energy Efficiency Directive’s final energy consumption target of 11.7% below the 2020 EU Reference scenario we which calculate to be 726 Mtoe, excluding international aviation in 2030.

We used the 2021 ratio between energy CO2 and all gases to estimate total emissions in 2030. For the other value in the ratio, we applied the same methods as indicated earlier but used the indicative additional target included in the Renewable Energy Directive of 2.5% (or 45% share total).

To develop a planned policies projection for the upper end of the range (i.e. minimal emission reductions), we take the projected GHG emissions under the S3 scenario from the 2040 target communication impact assessment by the European Commission (in AR5) and convert it to AR4 while at the same time removing the influence of international aviation. In the EU’s Fit for 55 modelling scenarios, international aviation is included in the final energy consumption and GHG emissions (European Commission, 2021b). To omit it, we subtract the international aviation energy consumption and GHG emissions from the totals.


## Proposed 2040 target

We take the EU’s modelled 2040 target from the S3 scenario presented in its impact assessment (European Commission, 2024b). We substitute the emissions from LULUCF in AR5 GWP and also excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation. We exclude the LULUCF emission but add in the planned assumptions for industrial carbon removals which include Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACCs) and Bioenergy Carbon Capture (BECCs). Regardless of scenario industrial removals are set at 75 MtCO2e. Finally, we convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.

This results in an emission reduction of 86% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels. We then apply the range of LULUCF assumptions (215, 317 and 376 MtCO2e) to determine the resulting emission reductions percentages from 1990. Building on the 85% baseline emission reductions, the added LULUCF options would resulting in 90%, 92% and 94% emissions reductions.


## Net-zero target

In December 2018, the European Commission published its assessment of the climate neutrality goal by 2050 for the EU28 (European Commission, 2018a, 2018c, 2018b). In 2024, as part of the EU’s 2040 target proposal’s Impact Assessment (European Commission, 2024b), new data was made available on the emission projections to 2050. Out of the four scenarios, we take the S3 scenario which best reflects the likely pathway the EU has indicated it will strive for.

We take the GHG emission in 2050 (excluding LULUCF) in AR5 and add in the assumed industrial carbon removals from DACCs and BECCs from the 2040 Target Impact Assessment. We provide a single projection and not a range based on the S3 scenario in the 2040 target impact assessment. This approach reflects what the EU Commission said it will pursue. We convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990 to get 295 MtCO2e as our target excluding LULUCF.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Some of the EU data used in our calculations is based on AR5 values. Please see the individual sections above for our conversion methods.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In October 2023, the EU submitted a revised NDC to the UNFCCC (Spain and the European Commission, 2023). Its target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e which is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target. The CAT rates this updated target as ‘did not increase ambition’ because it does not lead to a lower emissions limit (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) compared to the previous NDC.

Compared to the previous NDC update in 2020, this NDC update clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the goal.

The EU’s 2030 NDC is not close to the 1.5°C limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. It remains far behind on its fair share contribution to the 1.5°C limit and needs to substantially increase its support for emissions reductions abroad and climate finance.

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels. The CAT quantifies the 2040 target to be 660 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) or an 85% reduction from 1990. While the 2040 target does align with what would at least be needed domestically to be aligned with 1.5°C compared to modelled domestic pathways, the CAT believes that the EU should adopt at least a 95% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) by 2040 seeing as it is is failing to contribute its fair share to global climate action.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC submission from October 2023, the EU kept the same headline target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) as in its submission from December 2020 (Spain and the European Commission, 2023).

The updated NDC has increased the EU’s target for LULUCF removals to 310 MtCO2e up from 225 MtCO2e. The increase in the LULUCF sink is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target (European Parliament, 2022). However, if the EU were to use the additional 85 MtCO2e towards achieving its 2030 target – rather than the 225 MtCO2e referenced in the European Climate Law – then this would decrease the emissions reductions needed in other sectors. The CAT does not view this submission as representing an increase in ambition.

Other than the increase in the LULUCF sink, the most recent EU NDC update includes a summary of regulatory developments, and the main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed to in December 2020. It also clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the target. Based on this clarification, the CAT considers international aviation to be included in the EU’s NDC, but not international maritime emissions. Please see the Assumptions tab for more details on the quantification of the EU’s 2030 NDC.

The EU had previously submitted an update to its NDC in December 2020 (Germany & European Commission, 2020). The 2020 update provided a strengthened 2030 emissions reduction target of “at least 55%” compared to the first NDC’s target of “at least 40%” (Latvia and the European Commission, 2015). The inclusion of the land sector slightly weakens this target compared to its 2016 NDC, however, the inclusion of aviation strengthens it.

According to the Commission’s modelling reflecting the “Fit for 55” package, the EU’s emissions would amount to 2.2 GtCO2e in 2030, excluding LULUCF and international aviation[1] (European Commission, 2021a). As of the end of 2023, the EU has all the “Fit for 55” legislative framework in place to meet its “at least 55%” target. These policies still fall short of the domestic reductions needed to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Domestic emission reductions of at least 62% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) from 1990 are needed to make the EU’s effort compatible with 1.5°C, while currently the EU’s target results in a 52% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) reduction from 1990.

The EU is expected to submit an updated NDC with a target for 2035 at COP30 in 2025, but will likely folllowing the adoption of its 2040 target. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at least 74% excluding LULUCF, or a 78% reduction including LULUCF below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance. The European Commission suggests deriving the EU’s 2035 NDC from a linear trajectory between its 2030 and 2040 targets. The CAT would advocate for a non-linear trajectory based on 1.5°C compatible pathways, as delayed climate action only makes limiting warming to 1.5°C more difficult.

[1] The numbers provided in the scenario use Global Warming Potential from IPCC AR5. For the sake of comparability with other countries assessed by the Climate Action Tracker the number 2.256 MtCO2e is translated to AR4 resulting in 2.244 MtCO2e.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The EU does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

On October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC. The target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the EU’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” and is not enough to improve the EU’s fair share rating.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are higher than those of most other governments, but we still rate it “Insufficient.” The EU has committed to increasing its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel finance abroad. In its concluded negotiation position for the upcoming CO29, the EU neglects to address the need for significantly scaled-up financial support for developing countries, a key factor for enabling ambitious climate action and ensuring a fair global transition.

In 2022, the EU and its member states provided EUR 28.5 bn to developing countries (Council of the European Union, 2023a), but contributions still fall short of its fair share contribution. The EU remains committed through 2025 to the USD 100 bn collective goal of climate finance for developing countries, but the USD 100 bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period. The EU has not made clear how much its planned international climate finance contributions will be in the coming years.

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation Framework (SFDR) was established to promote transparency in sustainable investments to support informed investment decisions. However, this has failed due to broad and vague definitions of what constitute green investments. For example, European investment funds labelled as ”green” under the SFDR have been directed towards major coal firms outside the EU, including the US, China and India, amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

In February 2022, European Commission published a complementary climate-delegated act to its Taxonomy Regulation (Council of the European Union, 2022a), which states that energy generation from fossil gas and nuclear should be classified as transition activities: activities that cannot yet be replaced by low carbon alternatives but that do contribute to emissions reduction.

At COP29, the EU has reaffirmed that international public climate finance be focused on delivering on the New Collective Qualified Goal (NCQG). However, the EU has not indicated how much finance the bloc is ready to commit and has added a prerequisite to expand the number of contributors part of its position (CAN Europe, 2024).

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**New 2040 target proposed in February 2024**

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels (European Commission, 2024c). After the elections for the European Parliament, President von der Leyen reaffirmed support for the 90% target (von der Leyen, 2024a), which represents the least ambitious end of the 90-95% range initially recommended by the ESABCC (European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), 2023). Based on the assumptions in the EU’s Impact Assessment for the 2040 target (European Commission, 2024a), we quantify the target as an 85% emissions reduction from 1990 or 660 MtCO2e by 2040 (excluding LULUCF but including industrial removals from DACCs and BECCS). This means that the EU will rely on increasing its LULUCF sinks to achieve the remaining 5–10%. The EU seems unlikely to be able to achieve the upper end of the range because even with its most ambitious LULUCF sink the EU would only able to reach a 94% total emissions reduction in 2040 from 1990.

**Net zero target**

In April 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, setting into law the objective of collectively achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.” The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as agreed in the European Council’s conclusions from December 2019, has further been included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020.

The EU’s climate neutrality – or, essentially, net zero – target is “Acceptable” in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process.

At present, a clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing, although this is an element that is required of the forthcoming 2040 target. There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

**The full analysis is available** **here****.**


# Summary


## Overview

**European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has indicated her mandate for the next four years is to continue to pursue the goals of the European Green Deal (EGD), but will focus on implementation rather than increasing ambition. The EU has made significant progress in adopting the measures of the European Green Deal bringing it closer to achieving its 2030 target, but more action is required to close the gap.**

**However, the EU is not fully on track to meet its 2030 target to reduce emissions by at least 55% below 1990 (including** **LULUCF). The CAT therefore rates the EU’s overall climate action and current 2030 emissions reduction target as ‘Insufficient’.**

**The Commission's proposed 2040 target is a net 90% reduction in emissions below 1990, which represents the least ambitious end of the 90–95% range** **proposed** **by the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC).**

**The EU does not yet have a target specifically for 2035 emission reductions. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at** **least 74% (excl. LULUCF), or a 78% reduction (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance and other support for developing countries.**

The CAT finds that the EU’s proposed 2040 target of at least 90–95% reduction (including LULUCF) results in an emissions reduction of 85% when excluding LULUCF. This emission reduction target for 2040 would be consistent with 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways. There remains an open question however as to whether or not the emission pathway of the European Union from 2030 through 2040 is 1.5° aligned as whole and that can only be assessed once the European Union has submitted the relevant targets.

The EU has signalled that it recognises the importance of scaling up international climate finance and while it has been increasing its contributions, it would need drastically increase its financial support to achieve its own commitments. Positively, the EU has worked to mobilise more private finance, through for example the EU Taxonomy and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to make sustainable investments more transparent. The latter is currently being assessed to address its shortfalls around its sustainability criteria.

In 2023 at COP28, the EU called for a global phase-out of “unabated” fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies not used for a just transition, however the European Union has not yet moved to establish concrete domestic phase out targets for fossil fuels which would be needed to operationalise the transition away from these fuels as a matter of urgency. As a major importer of fossil fuels this will be an important initiative.

The EU has made significant progress over the past four years with the European Green Deal. Prior to the EGD, in 2019 the EU’s planned policies were projected to achieve only a 33% emission reduction by 2030 below 1990 levels. With its current planned policies, it is on track to achieve a 52% reduction. In 2024 alone, the EU successfully adopted key proposals under the EGD. Some of the major accomplishments included the revisions of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive, the Gas Regulation and Directive and the Methane Regulation. Positively these packages:

- Establish more ambitious mandates for renovating Europe’s buildings to be more efficient than before and signal a shift to move away from fossil fuels.
- Establish a framework for a hydrogen market, enabling the scaling up of hydrogen to support the decarbonisation of certain sectors such as industry and shipping.
- Introduce new requirements for the fossil fuel industry to monitory and report methane emission and to take appropriate mitigation measures to abate their emissions.
While these are positive steps in the right direction, many gaps and loopholes in these regulations remain and in some cases were missed opportunities to establish fossil fuel phase out and sector specific targets. To continue improving its climate action, the EU should:

- **Stop investing in additional fossil gas infrastructure and focus its efforts on the renewable energy transition.** This would also entail closing loopholes which make exceptions for fossil fuels, particularly LNG, to prevent the risk of long-term lock-in investments,
- **Agree to a full phase out fossil fuels** across all sectors, with coal phased out altogether by 2030, and fossil gas by 2035,
- **Strictly limit its dependence on carbon capture and storage** through to 2050 to only those sectors where there is no reasonable alternative to abatement at source or whole of system changes that could be deployed to eliminate CO2 emissions without the application of CCS. The EU should not allow CCS in the power sector as the sector can decarbonise completely without this technology,
- **Agree on an ambitious 2035 target** of at least 78% below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) and including fossil fuel phase-out dates,
- **Substantially increase its climate finance contributions**, including through returning revenues from the new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to support decarbonisation in developing countries, and
- **Update its long-term strategy for reaching its net zero target**, especially given that the EU Commission has assessed Member States’ progress towards the EU’s climate neutrality target as insufficient.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the EU’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

We rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share contribution and to modelled domestic pathways. To improve its rating, the EU should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target for 2030 to at least 62% (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) below 1990, close gaps and remove loopholes in existing policies prolonging fossil fuel use, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation.

The EU’s policies and action are also rated “Insufficient”. With the full implementation of the EU’s planned policies under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU initiatives the EU will come close to meeting its NDC target for 2030. However, not all proposals under the Fit for 55 package have been adopted. Targets and measures under available member states’ National Energy and Climate Plans are also failing to meet the EU’s targets, and half of member states have not submitted these plans. The overall lack of ambition of the EU’s 2030 NDC target will mean that it will need to adopt more rapid and deeper emission reduction measures later, in order to achieve a 1.5°C compatible pathway to climate neutrality by mid-century.

Current and planned policies will not be enough for the EU to reach its NDC target. The CAT rates the EU’s climate policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. This represents no change from the previous assessment as there have been no major new policy developments.

Since our last assessment (February 2024), the EU has adopted several proposals, such as the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive. However, others are still on the table, most notably the 2040 climate targets and Energy Taxation Directive, which we consider under our updated planned policies projections.

The upper bound of our policies and action emissions projection range is based on policies reported by member states in 2023, which would result in an emissions reduction of around 43% (excl. LULUCF) below 1990 by 2030. The bottom end of the range is based on policies adopted at the EU level, including the stronger binding renewable energy target (42.5%), which would result in reducing emissions by 49% (excl. LULUCF).

Our updated planned policies projection shows the EU comes close to achieving its NDC if all its proposals under the Fit for 55 and REPowerEU packages are implemented, achieving a 51% emissions reduction from 1990. The projection includes the EU’s indicative renewable energy goal (45%) and additional measures planned.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

In October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC with a target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) - which is the same as the previous EU NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e, implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the 2030 target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are rated as “Insufficient”. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its climate finance contributions in the period post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of international fossil finance.

The EU’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share target rating, and the CAT rates the EU’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

The EU’s climate neutrality target performs moderately in terms of its architecture, transparency, and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process. At present, a finalised clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing but indicate assumptions are provided in the proposed 2040 targets but these are yet to be formalised. We evaluate the net zero target design as “Acceptable”.

# Targets


## Target Overview

In October 2023, the EU submitted a revised NDC to the UNFCCC (Spain and the European Commission, 2023). Its target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e which is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target. The CAT rates this updated target as ‘did not increase ambition’ because it does not lead to a lower emissions limit (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) compared to the previous NDC.

Compared to the previous NDC update in 2020, this NDC update clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the goal.

The EU’s 2030 NDC is not close to the 1.5°C limit when compared to modelled domestic pathways. It remains far behind on its fair share contribution to the 1.5°C limit and needs to substantially increase its support for emissions reductions abroad and climate finance.

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels. The CAT quantifies the 2040 target to be 660 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF) or an 85% reduction from 1990. While the 2040 target does align with what would at least be needed domestically to be aligned with 1.5°C compared to modelled domestic pathways, the CAT believes that the EU should adopt at least a 95% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF) by 2040 seeing as it is is failing to contribute its fair share to global climate action.


## NDC updates

In its updated NDC submission from October 2023, the EU kept the same headline target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) as in its submission from December 2020 (Spain and the European Commission, 2023).

The updated NDC has increased the EU’s target for LULUCF removals to 310 MtCO2e up from 225 MtCO2e. The increase in the LULUCF sink is what enables the EU to assert that it will overachieve its 55% target (European Parliament, 2022). However, if the EU were to use the additional 85 MtCO2e towards achieving its 2030 target – rather than the 225 MtCO2e referenced in the European Climate Law – then this would decrease the emissions reductions needed in other sectors. The CAT does not view this submission as representing an increase in ambition.

Other than the increase in the LULUCF sink, the most recent EU NDC update includes a summary of regulatory developments, and the main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed to in December 2020. It also clarifies that only CO2 emissions from flights within the European Economic Area, departing flights to Switzerland and departing flights to the United Kingdom are included in the target. Based on this clarification, the CAT considers international aviation to be included in the EU’s NDC, but not international maritime emissions. Please see the Assumptions tab for more details on the quantification of the EU’s 2030 NDC.

The EU had previously submitted an update to its NDC in December 2020 (Germany & European Commission, 2020). The 2020 update provided a strengthened 2030 emissions reduction target of “at least 55%” compared to the first NDC’s target of “at least 40%” (Latvia and the European Commission, 2015). The inclusion of the land sector slightly weakens this target compared to its 2016 NDC, however, the inclusion of aviation strengthens it.

According to the Commission’s modelling reflecting the “Fit for 55” package, the EU’s emissions would amount to 2.2 GtCO2e in 2030, excluding LULUCF and international aviation[1] (European Commission, 2021a). As of the end of 2023, the EU has all the “Fit for 55” legislative framework in place to meet its “at least 55%” target. These policies still fall short of the domestic reductions needed to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Domestic emission reductions of at least 62% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) from 1990 are needed to make the EU’s effort compatible with 1.5°C, while currently the EU’s target results in a 52% (excl. LULUCF and international aviation) reduction from 1990.

The EU is expected to submit an updated NDC with a target for 2035 at COP30 in 2025, but will likely folllowing the adoption of its 2040 target. Based on modelled domestic pathways, the CAT would recommend a 2035 emissions reduction target of at least 74% excluding LULUCF, or a 78% reduction including LULUCF below 1990 levels, along with substantially increased climate finance. The European Commission suggests deriving the EU’s 2035 NDC from a linear trajectory between its 2030 and 2040 targets. The CAT would advocate for a non-linear trajectory based on 1.5°C compatible pathways, as delayed climate action only makes limiting warming to 1.5°C more difficult.

[1] The numbers provided in the scenario use Global Warming Potential from IPCC AR5. For the sake of comparability with other countries assessed by the Climate Action Tracker the number 2.256 MtCO2e is translated to AR4 resulting in 2.244 MtCO2e.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

- 21.05.2024: EU's Green Deal improved its climate performance: a 1.5°C pathway is close
- 06.02.2024: EU Commission's proposed 2040 target not quite 1.5°C compatible, pre-2030 action is key
- 06.02.2024: EU CAT Assessment
- 18.12.2020: EU Member states submitted to the UNFCCC a stronger 2030 domestic emissions target

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The EU does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

On October 2023, the EU submitted an updated NDC. The target of reducing emissions by at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF and international aviation) is the same as the previous NDC from December 2020. However, the EU has increased its land sector target by 85 MtCO2e implying that it is aiming to reduce net emissions by more than 55%. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation, the target equates to 52% below 1990 levels.

The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to the level of emissions reductions needed within the EU’s borders. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the EU’s total fair share contribution takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When measured against a fair share emissions allocation, we rate the EU’s NDC target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come from supporting additional emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The EU’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” and is not enough to improve the EU’s fair share rating.

The EU’s international public climate finance contributions are higher than those of most other governments, but we still rate it “Insufficient.” The EU has committed to increasing its climate finance, but contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating, the EU needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions post-2020 and accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel finance abroad. In its concluded negotiation position for the upcoming CO29, the EU neglects to address the need for significantly scaled-up financial support for developing countries, a key factor for enabling ambitious climate action and ensuring a fair global transition.

In 2022, the EU and its member states provided EUR 28.5 bn to developing countries (Council of the European Union, 2023a), but contributions still fall short of its fair share contribution. The EU remains committed through 2025 to the USD 100 bn collective goal of climate finance for developing countries, but the USD 100 bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period. The EU has not made clear how much its planned international climate finance contributions will be in the coming years.

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation Framework (SFDR) was established to promote transparency in sustainable investments to support informed investment decisions. However, this has failed due to broad and vague definitions of what constitute green investments. For example, European investment funds labelled as ”green” under the SFDR have been directed towards major coal firms outside the EU, including the US, China and India, amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

In February 2022, European Commission published a complementary climate-delegated act to its Taxonomy Regulation (Council of the European Union, 2022a), which states that energy generation from fossil gas and nuclear should be classified as transition activities: activities that cannot yet be replaced by low carbon alternatives but that do contribute to emissions reduction.

At COP29, the EU has reaffirmed that international public climate finance be focused on delivering on the New Collective Qualified Goal (NCQG). However, the EU has not indicated how much finance the bloc is ready to commit and has added a prerequisite to expand the number of contributors part of its position (CAN Europe, 2024).

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

**New 2040 target proposed in February 2024**

In February 2024, the European Commission proposed a 2040 target of a 90% net GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels (European Commission, 2024c). After the elections for the European Parliament, President von der Leyen reaffirmed support for the 90% target (von der Leyen, 2024a), which represents the least ambitious end of the 90-95% range initially recommended by the ESABCC (European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change (ESABCC), 2023). Based on the assumptions in the EU’s Impact Assessment for the 2040 target (European Commission, 2024a), we quantify the target as an 85% emissions reduction from 1990 or 660 MtCO2e by 2040 (excluding LULUCF but including industrial removals from DACCs and BECCS). This means that the EU will rely on increasing its LULUCF sinks to achieve the remaining 5–10%. The EU seems unlikely to be able to achieve the upper end of the range because even with its most ambitious LULUCF sink the EU would only able to reach a 94% total emissions reduction in 2040 from 1990.

**Net zero target**

In April 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, setting into law the objective of collectively achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.” The objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, as agreed in the European Council’s conclusions from December 2019, has further been included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020.

The EU’s climate neutrality – or, essentially, net zero – target is “Acceptable” in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, including a legally-binding review and assessment process.

At present, a clear separation of the contributions from emissions reductions versus removals is missing, although this is an element that is required of the forthcoming 2040 target. There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

**The full analysis is available** **here****.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the EU’s net zero target as: **Acceptable.**

In 2021, the European Union adopted its Climate Law, which enshrines its collective objective of achieving “climate neutrality by 2050.”

The EU’s climate–neutrality - or, essentially, net zero GHG emissions – target is acceptable in terms of its architecture, transparency and scope, with a regular review and assessment process.

There is room for improvement in the target’s scope, as the European Climate Law currently does not clearly state that international aviation and maritime transport emissions are included, and an explanation of why net zero by 2050 constitutes a fair contribution is lacking.

As required under the Climate Law, the Commission has assessed in 2023 the progress of the EU’s climate policy towards meeting its net zero target for the first time (European Commission, 2023a). The Commission found progress to be insufficient. The assessment stresses that all parts of the Fit-for-55 legislative package must be rapidly implemented and that the EU and its member states need to significantly increase the pace of emissions reductions, to almost triple the average annual reduction achieved over the last decade (European Commission, 2023a).

## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The EU aims to reach net zero by 2050 at the latest, with net negative emissions thereafter.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy.
- **International aviation and maritime transport** – The target only covers international aviation. The EU has adopted policies partially covering international maritime emissions, however, this bunker is not covered in its final targets. Both international aviation and maritime emissions are not clearly mentioned in the European Climate Law.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The EU plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and will not use removals outside its borders. The European Climate Law states that the balance between emissions and removals is to be achieved domestically.
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The EU passed its net zero target into law with its European Climate Law in 2021 (European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, 2021). The net zero target is further included in the EU’s LTS submitted to the UNFCCC in 2020 (Croatian Presidency and the European Commission, 2020)
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The EU does not provide separate emission reduction and removal targets as part of its net zero target. However, in its latest proposal for 2040 targets to achieve net zero emission by 2050, it highlighted separate information on emission and removal pathways but this is yet to be adopted as a target (European Commission, 2024b).
- **Review process** – The EU has a legally binding process in place to review the net zero target itself. The EU Climate Law includes a legally binding process for the Commission to report on the operation of the regulation within six months of each Global Stocktake (Article 9a). When it does so, the Commission may include proposals for amendments to the regulation. There is also a provision on the tracking of collective progress of the EU towards the achievement of net zero (Article 5), every five years.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The EU provides transparent pathways for LULUCF and separately for removals and storage. In the Commission’s impact assessment of 2040 targets, pathways for LULUCF and industrial removal across sectors are modelled between 2030 and 2050 (European Commission, 2018c, 2024b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – The Climate Law has set an intermediate target of a GHG emissions reduction of 55% by 2030 (below 1990 levels). The Commission is in the process of passing 2040 target based on projected emissions budget for 2030-2050. The Commission’s underlying analysis for the climate neutrality strategy identifies clear pathways and key measures for reaching net zero, with sector-specific detail, under four different scenarios.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The EU refers to the social fairness of the appropriate measures and fairness between EU Member States but makes no reference to global fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target. In its 2040 target communication, the commission makes reference to climate diplomacy and partnerships to encourage global decarbonisation but does not provide detail on what fair share elements it considers (European Commission, 2024c).

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target

The EU has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.


# Policies & action

The CAT rates the EU’s current policies and actions against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the EU’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the EU’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

With its current policies in place, the EU’s emissions will reach between 2,470 and 2,755 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030. This current policies pathway does not set it on track to meet its existing 2030 NDC target of 2,307 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. This represents 3–9% ambition gap. For more details on our projections, see the Assumptions tab.

To be 1.5°C compatible, current policies would need to reach at least 1,815 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emission reductions needed domestically to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

Our planned policies projections of 2,370–2,400 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) reflects the EU’s 2030 indicative renewable energy goal (of a further 2.5%, totalling 45%) as well as policy proposals that have been announced but remain to be adopted, most notably is the Energy Taxation Directive. If the EU adhered to the full list of planned policies, then it would be close to achieving its 2030 NDC target, missing the mark by 1–2%.

The full spectrum of policies proposed and adopted under the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU legislative packages have been effective in improving projected emission reductions by 2030, though some of the regulations are yet to come into effect.

Despite the enormous regulatory exercise that the EU has been pursuing, many gaps still remain, with loopholes and lax enforcement mechanisms in the policy design. Additional action is required to address these issues, including:

## Policy overview

Economy-wide emissions across the EU have continued to fall since 2019, when the new European government at the time came to power, roughly by 6% from 2019 to 2022 (the last available data point). In June 2024, European Parliament elections were held, and President von der Leyen was re-elected as head of the European Commission. The new work plan for the next Commission has signalled a shift towards framing climate action in the context of decarbonising Europe’s industries, focusing on competitiveness on a global stage and an increasing attention towards developing a new market for carbon removals.

In its previous legislative cycle (2019–2024), the European Green Deal which encapsulated the Fit-for-55 package and REPowerEU legislative packages set out a path for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Some key policies and regulations introduced and revised include the:

- Renewable Energy Directive (RED III)
- Energy Efficiency Directive
- new EU ETS II covering transport and buildings
- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
- Effort Sharing Directive
**For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here**

In the past year, the final elements of the Fit-for-55 and REPowerEU packages were finalised and adopted prior to the June elections including the; Gas Regulation and Directive, Methane Regulation, Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and Carbon Removal Certification Framework, which are covered in more details for this assessment.

President von der Leyen’s plans to launch a “Clean Industrial Deal” seeking to build upon existing policies to pivot Europe’s industries. The plan focuses on scaling up manufacturing of net-zero emission technologies and investing in skilled workers to satisfy the growing domestic need for net-zero emission technologies, like electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps (von der Leyen, 2024a). With this revision to existing industry related policies, the EU aims to become a global competitor with China and the US in the green technology market race. There will be a big push for expanding and improving rail networks and performance, which is a key measure needed to facilitate a modal shift to an alternative less carbon intensive mode of transport compares to airplanes and cars.


## Power sector

The EU has a binding renewable energy target of 42.5%, and an indicative target of 45% by 2030 across all sectors set by the revised Renewable Energy Directive. Under the REPowerEU package, the Commission has indicated that the EU would need to achieve 69% of renewable energy in power generation to achieve this overarching renewable target of 42.5% – 45%. Member states are expected to outline how they will achieve their share of this target in the updated NECPs which were due in June 2024. As of October 2024, only 13 have submitted their final updates.

The draft 2023 NECPs highlighted that their combined ambition was not enough to achieve the EU’s 2030 targets (European Commission, 2023b). While the renewable energy targets in the NECPs have improved, in many cases the NECPs did not include the necessary supporting measures required to achieve the targets. The final member state NECPs missing the submission deadline, and lack of concrete measures, does not instil confidence that member states will adhere to their climate commitments (Climate Action Network, 2024).

Following the June European Parliamentary elections, the incoming Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to increase investments into modernising Europe’s electricity grids over the next legislative cycle (von der Leyen, 2024a). The EU Grid Action Plan announced in November 2023 will be crucial to modernise Europe’s electricity grid to prepare it for the incoming surge of renewables and increased demand for electricity by 2030 (European Commission, 2023c). The plan will invest EUR 584 bn but lacks specific target dates for many of its actions which puts their implementation at risk (Mindekova & Cremona, 2024).


### Coal

The EU’s coal power share has been trending downward for some time and is heading in the right direction but at too slow a pace, with an average annual reduction rate of only 1.1% (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). In May 2023, coal power generation dropped to 12%, an all-time low (Ember, 2023). Overall, usage in the first half of 2023 was down by close to a quarter. To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

The EU signed up to the coal exit pledge at COP26, but did not include the coal exit as part of its 2023 NDC update. While a large majority of the EU member states either don’t use coal power or have an exit date before 2030, a handful still have later dates. As of 2024, 20 EU member states already have no coal in their electricity generation or coal power phase-out dates prior to 2030, while 6 countries have a phase out date beyond 2030 and only one country has not committed to phase out coal entirely (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). In 2023, France, Italy and Hungary delayed their coal exits but still maintain a deadline before 2030 (Beyond Fossil Fuels, 2024).

The EU bloc does not seem to fund coal projects overseas. However, some European investors have investments or shareholdings in coal projects and major coal companies across several non-EU countries including India, China, the US, Indonesia and South Africa, classified as “green”, and amounting to EUR 65 million as of April 2024 (Civillini & Rodriguez, 2024).

The 2021 Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) were supposed to be a transparency framework, introduced to prevent greenwashing and promote more sustainable investing. However it has been ineffective because Articles 8 and 9 of the SFDR inadequately categorise green investments. Article 8 is too broad in its sustainability scope, and Article 9 lacks consistency in defining what qualifies as a sustainable investment. The EU is now conducting an assessment on the effectiveness of this legislation (European Commission, 2024f). This presents the Commission with an opportunity to further close its policy gaps and resolve the loopholes for fossil fuel investments.


### Fossil gas and oil

In 2023, about 21% of the EU’s electricity generation came from oil and fossil gas, down by 3% compared to 2022 (Ember, 2024). To be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT finds that the EU would need to phase out fossil gas by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). While fossil gas in electricity generation is on the decline the pace is far too slow.

The EU has agreed to extend its fossil gas demand reduction target until the end of March 2024 (Council of the European Union, 2023b). Continuing to focus on cutting demand and shifting to renewable sources is a positive development. CAT analysis shows that the EU’s fossil gas strategy risks carbon lock-in and undermines global climate action.

In its efforts to move away from Russian gas following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its member states have diversified their fossil gas imports from other countries in the form of LNG. This has been accompanied by massive investment buildout in LNG terminals and gas pipelines to the tune of EUR 84 bn (Rozansk & Hassan, 2024). Consequently, Europe now has an overcapacity of LNG facilities representing long term stranded assets, further exacerbated by the decreasing demand for gas and with consumers bearing the high price of LNG (Jaller-Makarewicz, 2023). LNG imports peaked in spring 2023 and have been on the decline since.

**Revised Gas Package**

The EU recently adopted the revised Gas Directive and Regulation, intended to “shift from fossil gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen, and to establish and regulate the upcoming market for hydrogen” (European Council, 2023). Positively, it requires fossil gas distribution operators to develop plans to decommission gas networks and establishes a new and independent governance structure for the future transmission of hydrogen. This new hydrogen market is intended to prioritise the hard-to-abate sectors but the legislation fails to introduce guardrails to guarantee this. There are other concerns:

- The legislation covers low carbon gases but fails to provide a definition as to what a low carbon gaseous fuel is, risking that low carbon fuels could be derived from fossil fuels.
- Long term fossil gas supply contracts are also allowed to run until 2049.
The gas package was a missed opportunity to introduce a legally binding commitment to phase out fossil gas. The consultation process is still open for the delegated Act to define the criteria and methodology for defining low carbon gaseous fuels, representing an opportunity for the EU to strengthen any weaknesses in the gas package (Climate Action Network Europe, 2024). Needless to say that the current policy direction is still heading in the wrong direction.

There remains a mismatch between current energy needs and the time needed for all of these projects to go online, which makes them difficult to justify as low carbon alternatives when investment in energy efficiency can be brought online instead. The need for such a significant investment in fossil gas infrastructure has been countered by an assessment indicating that the EU can do without Russian gas without investing heavily into fossil fuel infrastructure (European Climate Foundation, 2022).


### Renewables

In 2023, the EU’s power sector ran on 44% of renewable sources (including biomass) (Climate Analytics, 2024). Of this, wind and solar collectively contribute to about 26% (Ember). The CAT finds that to align with 1.5°C the EU should aim to achieve at least 87% of renewables in electricity generation by 2030 and a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The deployment of wind and solar in the EU has been gaining traction in recent years, averaging 2.2% annual growth and is heading in the right direction but the pace is too slow and would need to increase to about 3.1% growth per year (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

**There have been no new policy updates since the CAT’s last assessment. For more detail see the previous assessment from February 2024** **here** .


### Nuclear energy

The EU included nuclear energy in the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), recognising it as a "strategic" technology. The NZIA supports nuclear technologies like small modular reactors, highlighting their potential to provide low-carbon energy with minimal waste, crucial for decarbonisation and energy security (European Commission, 2023d). In its 2040 climate target communication, the Commission did not specify any target or actions towards nuclear capacity build up but reaffirms nuclear a low carbon fuel needed to achieve its targets.

Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT doesn’t see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with the flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar and its vulnerability to heat waves.


## Industry

The EU’s industrial emissions, both energy related and from industrial processes, accounted for about 24% of its total GHG emissions in 2021 (Climate Analytics, 2024; UNFCCC, 2023). Industrial emissions have been falling on average about 2.3% per year but this is not fast enough and the EU’s industry will need to accelerate this 1.3 times faster than its current trend to reach 1.5°C compatibility (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b).

The EU has not signed the Beyond Oil and Gas (BOGA) declaration but eight of its member states have. Six member states — Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden — are core members of the Alliance and have committed to ending oil and fossil gas exploration and development (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021).

To decarbonise its industries, the EU introduced indicative targets in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU 2023/2413) for the share of renewables in industry. Article 22 requires the industry sectors in member states to increase the share of renewable energy by an average annual rate of 1.6% between 2021 and 2030. This annual 1.6% indicative benchmark was watered down by the Commission from the initial 1.9% growth rate it estimated it would need to deliver on the REPowerEU objectives (European Commission, 2022a).

The revised Renewable Energy Directive also requires that only 42% of incorporated hydrogen be derived from renewable energy by 2030 and 60% by 2035. This means that the industry will use a mix of renewable and fossil fuel derived hydrogen. This design will allow industries to start their shift to hydrogen but access cheaper fossil fuel derived hydrogen until the green hydrogen is available at scale and affordably. The EU does not have any provisions to fully eliminate fossil fuel derived hydrogen from industry beyond 2035, which risks the long-term dependence on fossil derived hydrogen.

**Green hydrogen**

The Commission’s Hydrogen Strategy sets out that installed capacity of electrolysers in the EU should reach 40 GW by 2030, resulting in the production of up to 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen, complemented with similar capacity installed in neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2020). The EU hydrogen policy framework has several key gaps hindering market development and does not go far enough to address issues such as high-cost entry barriers and uncertainties. At present, renewable hydrogen is also much more expensive than fossil fuel-based hydrogen. Financial support is fragmented, with a shortage of targeted funds necessary to meet the 2030 REPowerEU goals. Additionally, the EU lacks a clear definition for low-carbon hydrogen, and is only expected to develop a methodology by 2025 as part of the Delegated Act of the revised Gas Regulation.

**Developing a net zero technology Industry**

To tackle replacing industrial technology with cleaner alternatives, the EU has been developing a nexus of polices to facilitate the growth of (1) net zero technology industry and (2) industrial carbon removals, encapsulated by the:

- Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) (EU) 2024/1735, and more broadly the Green Industrial Plan
- Industrial Carbon Management Strategy
- Carbon Removal Certification Framework (proposal)
- 2040 climate targets (proposal)
In June 2024, the Net Zero Industry Act entered into force (European Parliament & European Council, 2024c). It focuses on 19 net zero technologies. It also includes the objective of developing annual injection capacity for carbon capture and storage of 50 MtCO2e by 2030 that should be used to mitigate residual emissions. These capacities should be developed by oil and fossil gas companies proportionally to their current oil and gas production levels.

The NZIA will be crucial to operationalising the direction set by the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy (ICMS) (European Commission, 2024d). The ICMS lays out how it plans to scale up industrial carbon removals to deliver the EU’s climate neutrality objective, most notably from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs) and direct air carbon capture (DACC).

It sets out a target to reach 50 MtCO2e in carbon removals annually by 2030. The ICMS is strongly linked to the proposed 2040 targets, which are yet to be adopted. In its impact assessment the Commission envisions it would need about 75 MtCO2e of industrial carbon removals from BECCs and DACCs by 2040. Additionally, the Commission will create policy options and support mechanisms for industrial carbon removals, including considerations on whether and how to integrate them into the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) but this is not expected until the planned revision of the ETS in 2026 (EPG, 2024).

In April 2024, the political agreement was reached on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) but is still to be adopted (Carbon Gap, 2024a; European Commission, 2022b). The CRCF seeks to establish a framework to certify the emission removals from carbon farming, carbon storage in products and industrial carbon removals (from technologies like Direct Air Carbon Capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs). The CRCF is the mechanism to deliver on the goals of the ICMS and lays out the role the CDR will play. The CRCF gives the Commission the ability to assess options for CDR and CCS targets.

The CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could go against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits.

The 2040 climate target communication keeps the role of CCS in the power sector vague under the proposed 2040 targets. This is worrying as the application of CCS to certain sectors is left open to interpretation. The incoming Commission has the opportunity during the subsequent expansion of the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy and Clean Industry Deal to clearly commit to no CCS in the power sector.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) refers to technologies which use engineered methods to capture CO2 from a source and store it geologically. CCS can be applied to a range of different CO2 sources in different sectors. CCS technologies are neither commercially viable nor proven at scale, despite large public subsidies for research and development globally.

Heavily relying on unproven CCS for power generation simply prolongs the use of fossil fuels, diverting attention and resources away from the necessary and urgent switch to renewable energy generation that drives down actual emissions.

The use of CCS should be limited to industrial applications where there are fewer options to reduce process emissions—not to reduce emissions from the electricity sector where renewables are cost-effective mitigation alternatives, not least because CCS doesn't remove 100% of emissions from power plants.


## Transport

Transport is the only major sector in the EU where emissions have increased over the last 30 years: emissions in 2022 followed an upward trend of 2.7% compared to 2021. It is too early to say whether emissions from the sector have peaked: the economic rebound and trend towards bigger vehicles may undermine the impact of increasing EV sales on emission levels.

The EU has introduced several policies and regulations to reduce emissions from the transport sector across all transport modes. These include but are not limited to:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413, through the adoption of sectoral renewable energy targets,
- Revised Regulation strengthening CO2 emission performance standards for new cars and vans (EU) 2023/851, which established a ban on the sale of combustion engine cars by 2035.
- Revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (EU) 2024/1679
- New EU ETS II which covers road transport emissions from 2027
In 2023, electric vehicle (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) made up 22% of vehicle sales. To be 1.5°C compatible in line with the Paris Agreement, the CAT finds that the EU would need to achieve 95–100% sales of light-duty electric vehicle sales by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). This is five years earlier than the EU’s current target of 2035. The EU did not sign the Zero Emissions Vehicle pledge at COP26 and did not include this target in its NDC.

In President von der Leyen’s political guidelines for the next four years in office, she hinted that the 2035 ban on the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles might be watered down through the increased use of alternative fuels to achieve the ban (Mathiesen et al., 2024). The ban on fossil fuel car sales has an exemption to allow synthetic e-fuels to continue beyond 2035. Positively, the guidelines also pushes for greater improvements to the EU’s rail network to encourage a stronger modal shift towards rail (von der Leyen, 2024b).

In June 2024, the EU adopted the revised Regulation on the trans-European transport Network (TEN-T) (European Parliament & European Council, 2024b). The regulation intends to create the enabling conditions to scale up zero emission transport modes, improving connecting and promoting a modal shift to more share and zero mission transport.

While no new transport regulations have been adopted since the last CAT assessment in February 2024, some have been revised or are still pending agreement such as the CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicle and the Green Freight Package.

Gaps still remain for some regulations. For example, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation (EU) 2023/1805 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023c) and the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation (EU) 2023/1804 (European Parliament & European Council, 2023) consider LNG a “low carbon fuel” in shipping. As LNG is a fossil fuel, its prolonged or expanded use will make it difficult to achieve future emission reductions given the long lifetime of ships and infrastructure, resulting in stranded assets.

To reach full decarbonisation in the transport sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to increase the share of zero emission fuels (electricity, hydrogen and biofuels) from 7% in 2019 to 55% by 2030. This covers all modes of domestic transport collectively (i.e. road, rail, domestic aviation and maritime travel) (Climate Action Tracker, 2024).

**Tariffs on Chinese EVs**

In October 2024, the EU Commission announced new tariffs on battery EVs manufactured in China on the basis that the Chinese government unfairly subsidies its EVs, undercutting European car manufacturers. Individual duties will range between 17.4% to 37.6% depending on the Chinese manufacturer (European Commission, 2024e).

To be 1.5°C compatible, the EU needs continued exponential growth in EV sales, needs a lot of them to meet demand, and needs to make it affordable for consumers (Climate Action Tracker, 2024). One of the major barriers to this is affordability. Chinese EV models sold across EU member states are typically cheaper than European manufactured vehicles, which could affect consumer choices.


## Buildings

In 2021, buildings accounted for 13% of the EU’s total GHG emissions (Climate Analytics, 2024), consuming 40% of the EU’s final energy consumption. The buildings sector has traditionally been heavily reliant on fossil gas and oil. High energy prices triggered by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is having some impact on consumer behaviour and spurring policy action in the sector. GHG emissions in buildings have been steadily falling since 1990, but not fast enough (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a).

The main legislation driving the decarbonisation of the EU’s building sector fall under:

- Revised Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2023/2413
- Revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EU) 2023/1791
- Revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU) 2024/1275
- New EU ETS II which covers buildings sector
The revised Renewable Energy Directive sets an EU wide target to achieve 49% share of renewables in the final energy consumption in buildings by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023a). The revised Energy Efficiency Directive sets a binding target to reduce the final energy consumption by 11.7% relative to the 2020 or a target of 763 Mtoe of final energy consumption by 2030 across all sectors (European Parliament, 2023).

The EED lacks robust measures specifically targeting the building sector, focusing instead on general improvements in energy efficiency and renovation rates linked to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. As of early 2024, no updated NECP submissions from member states fully comply with EED requirements, revealing a concerning lack of commitment. Furthermore, only twelve member states recognise the broader renovation obligation for public buildings (Chapelot et al., 2024), highlighting significant implementation gaps that undermine the EU's climate ambitions.

According to the reform of the EU ETS agreed in early 2023, the buildings sector will be covered by a new emissions trading scheme (EU ETS II) from 2027 onward. The requirement to purchase emission allowances to cover the sale of fossil fuels used in the transport and building sectors will further increase the incentive for home insulation and installation of clean sources of heating.

The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), adopted in 2024, includes several important measures aimed at achieving a zero emission building sectors by 2050. One of the most significant changes is the mandate that all new buildings must meet "zero emission" standards by 2030. While a step in the right direction, the proposal was watered down from the EU Commission's initial plan, which called for binding EU-level minimum energy performance standards.

While the EPBD targets a 3.5% annual renovation rate by 2030, which aligns with 1.5°C compatible benchmarks, the EU’s current renovation rate stands at only around 1% annually (Climate Action Tracker, 2020; European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024b). The Directive also targets the renovation of 15% of the EU's building stock by 2030, but this is widely regarded as insufficient to meet climate goals (European Climate Neutrality Observatory, 2024a). The table below provides a summary of the main targets set out in the EPBD (BPIE, 2024).

The revised EPBD missed an opportunity to fully address the issue of locking in fossil fuel heating systems, by introducing an ambiguous ban on fossil fuel boilers by 2040, while it did ban member states from subsiding the installation of fossil fuel boilers from 2025. The 2040 ban leaves the member state to decide whether or not they wish to include this in their national phase-out plans (Verplancke et al., 2024).

The implementation timeline of the revised EPBD is too slow. Key milestones, such as mandatory solar installations for new public and commercial buildings by 2027 and minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings by 2033, push essential changes far into the future. This drawn-out schedule is seen as inadequate to meet the urgent decarbonisation goals needed to address the climate crisis.

To reach full decarbonisation in the buildings sector globally by mid-century, the EU would need to reduce the emission intensity (kgCO2/m2) in residential buildings and commercial buildings by 60% and 75% respectively by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. In energy saving terms, the EU would need to reduce the energy intensity (kWh/m2) by 30% and 25%, respectively, by 2030.


## Agriculture

Agriculture accounts for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions in 2021 (UNFCCC, 2023). The EU agricultural sector generates about 60% of its emissions from methane, nearly all of which come from livestock, primarily through enteric fermentation and manure management (Eurostat, 2022). Despite this, methane reduction efforts remain insufficient.

While the EU is a co-initiator of the Global Methane Pledge, aiming to cut global methane emissions by 30% below 2020 levels by 2030, only 11 member states have committed to reducing methane from livestock, covering less than 3% of the EU’s livestock units. Leaked reports indicate the EU is not on track to meet its methane reduction target, signifying the need for stronger measures (Ainger, 2022; Changing Markets, 2022). Previous Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) efforts from 2014–2020 had limited success in cutting emissions, focusing instead on increasing CO2 removals (European Union, 2022).

Early 2024 saw widespread protests by farmers against the climate and nature regulations under the Green Deal reach a fever-pitch across many member states, particularly around cutting subsidies for fossil fuels and pesticides (Dwyer, 2024). This prompted the EU to backtrack on some of its initiatives to cut emissions from agriculture under the proposed 2040 target, including on introducing sectoral targets for the first time. The Commission also rapidly passed a new regulation (EU 2024/1468) to limit some of the environmental requirements for farmers under the CAP (2023-2027), which weakened its environmental impact (European Parliament & European Council, 2024a).

The European Court of Auditors (ECA) criticised the 2023–2027 CAP strategic plans for falling short of the EU’s climate and environmental ambitions. Despite being more ambitious than previous plans, the new CAP still lacks alignment with the European Green Deal targets. The ECA recommended that the Commission promote more environmental best practices, estimate CAP’s contribution to the Green Deal, and improve its monitoring of climate and environmental outcomes (ECA, 2024).

Key to the EU achieving its 2040 targets would be the introduction of an emission reductions target for the agricultural sector combined with a levy on agricultural emission. In June 2024, Denmark took a first step in this direction by becoming the first country to introduce an agricultural carbon tax and is pushing for this to be applied at an EU level (Mooney et al., 2024) .

The influence of farmer protests were significant enough to mark a shift in the EU’s tone on regulating farmers. Critically, the EU will need to find alternative pathways in supporting farmers as they transition to decarbonise and adapt to climate impacts but continuing with exemptions risks failing to deliver on net zero by 2050.


## Forestry

Since 1990, the land use, land-use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) had constituted a sink of emissions averaging around 300 MtCO2e. However, since 2017, the sink has decreased significantly, amounting to around 230 MtCO2e in 2021.

The EU recently agreed to revisions to the LULUCF regulation (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023d), which governs the sector. It increased its 2030 target to 310 MtCO2e, up from the 225 MtCO2e limit referenced in its Climate Law. The revisions included individual targets for each member state towards the 310 MtCO2e level. While enhancing the size of the land sink is positive, it should not undermine the level of ambition in other sectors.

The EU’s incoming Carbon Removal Certification Framework will also have ramifications for emission in the forestry sector (Carbon Gap, 2024b; European Commission, 2022c). Worryingly, the CRCF is riddled with concerning elements that could work against climate action. The regulation lacks a distinction between emission reductions and removal, potentially allowing removals to offset emissions that should be reduced. It also risks offsetting and greenwashing through the permitting of sales of carbon credits as offsets in voluntary carbon markets, especially if large emitters are allowed to buy these credits (EEB, 2024). **For more details on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework, see the Industry section.**

In the impact assessment for the 2040 climate targets, while not yet proposed, modelling indicated that the removals from LULUCF in 2040 could amount to somewhere between 215 MtCO2e and 376 MtCO2e with 317 MtCO2e as the central value(European Commission, 2024b). Our assessment of the EU’s proposed 2040 target indicates that the EU intends to achieve 86% emissions reductions by 2040 compared to 1990, excluding LULUCF emissions but including removals from industrial technologies such as DACCS and BECCS. This means that the EU will need to rely on expanding its LULUCF sink to achieve the remain 4–9% emission reductions. Additionally, even the largest estimated LULUCF sink of 376 MtCO2e under consideration is not sufficient to reach the 95% emission reduction.


## Waste

Waste sector emissions have continuously fallen since the mid-90s, dropping by 40% between 1990 and 2021 (European Environment Agency, 2023a).

Regulation of waste sector emissions is covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), along with those from transport, buildings, and agriculture. Combined, emissions from these sectors needs to decrease by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 (European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023e).

As of 2024, the European Parliament has voted to strengthen the proposed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme for textiles. The European Parliament's approval of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for textiles is seen as a step forward, but it lacks specific waste prevention targets and effective management strategies.

Meanwhile, the EU Council has prioritised textile reforms, neglecting critical food waste reduction measures. This approach is viewed as insufficiently ambitious, highlighting the need for stronger commitments to ensure both textile and food waste are managed effectively for sustainable outcomes (Zero Waste Europe, 2024) . The current design may not adequately incentivise producers to improve product design for longevity and recyclability, with some suggesting that the focus remains too heavily on waste management rather than preventing waste generation.


## Methane

In 2022, methane emissions accounted for 11% of the EU’s total GHG emissions. The majority of these emissions came from the agricultural sector, followed by waste management and energy. Methane emissions have fallen about 60% since 1990 (UNFCCC, 2024).

The EU signed the methane pledge at COP26 in 2021. Methane is covered in the overall scope of the EU’s latest NDC from 2023 but is also specifically mentioned in the context of mitigating methane emissions from maritime transport under the revised EU ETS. In 2020, the EU released its methane reduction strategy laying out its intention to cut emissions from energy, agriculture, and waste.

As part of the strategy, in 2024, the EU adopted the regulation on methane emission reduction in the energy sector (EU) 2024/1787 (European Parliament & European Council, 2024d), covering emissions from oil and fossil gas exploration, production, transmission, distribution, coal mining and imports of fossil fuels.

The regulation introduces new measures to measure, report and verify (MRV) methane emissions, methane abatement measures and a ban on routine venting and flaring. While a step in the right direction, the regulation does not go far enough – starting with the lack of an overarching methane reduction target and prolonged implementation timeline, which does not reflect the urgency and pace needed.

In addition, many exemptions and loopholes diminish the regulation's effectiveness. The regulation excludes the petrochemical sector and LNG consumption. Methane intensive LNG can be expected to grow considerably, given the signal that other EU polices are pushing. For example, the FuelEU Maritime for LNG fuel in shipping, as well as the build up of LNG infrastructure over the past few years following the shift away from imported Russian gas (Climate Action Network Europe, 2023). A recent study finds that LNG as a fuel has an emission footprint 33% greater than that of coal due to the associated methane leakage (Howarth, 2024). Additionally, despite representing the largest source of methane, the agricultural sector is not included. Instead, it is counted under the overall GHG emission reduction target for member states under the Revised Effort Sharing Directive.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions between 1990 and 2022 are based on the national inventory submitted by the EU to the UNFCCC (European Environment Agency, 2024). The data is presented in AR5 GWP values, so we convert it to AR4 GWP using gas-by-gas conversions.


## NDC and other targets

Since our last update in February 2024, the CAT has not changed its methodology for quantifying the EU’s 2030 absolute emissions target. Our current approach aligns with the EEA’s quantification of the target (European Environment Agency, 2023c). Note that the EEA’s NDC quantification includes international aviation.

- We take the EU’s 1990 emissions including LULUCF in AR5 GWP, excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation, and apply a 55% reduction to this value (European Environment Agency, 2024).
- Then we add the difference between the sink (217 MtCO2e) in 1990 and the sink of 225 MtCO2e that the EU is allowed to use towards achieving its NDC target as outlined in the European Climate Law.
- As the CAT excludes LULUCF from absolute target values, we then remove sink of 225 MtCO2e and convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.
While the LULUCF Regulation, passed in April 2023, adopts an EU-wide LULUCF sink of 310 MtCO2e, the EU has made clear that this additional sink capacity will help it exceed its 55% target and not count towards achieving it (European Parliament, 2022; European Parliament & Council of the European Union, 2023b). As such, we do not exclude this additional LULUCF capacity from our quantification of the target.

CO2 emissions from intra-EU flights, (as well as those departing flights to Switzerland and the United Kingdom) fall within the scope of the NDC as they are covered under the EU ETS. However, we do not consider these emissions to be part of the target quantification itself (as described above), but relevant to assessing compliance with it. As such, intra-EU CO2 aviation are not included in our NDC target calculations.


## Current policy projections

The assessment of the EU’s policy projections reflects both policies and measures implemented at the national level (the top end of our range), as well as these adopted at the EU level but not yet transposed by the Member States (the bottom end of our range).

To reflect policies adopted at the national level, we use the EEA’s compilation of national projections prepared by Member States in 2023 (European Environment Agency, 2023b). We apply the growth rate from the ‘with existing measures’ (WEM) scenario for total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) to total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF and excl. int. aviation) in 2022.

To calculate the bottom end of the range, we replace estimates for power CO2 emissions in the States Policies (STEPS) projections from the World Energy Outlook (WEO) with those from the Announced Pledges (APS) to account for the implementation of the 42.5% RE share in final gross consumption in the Fit for 55 package. From the Fit for 55 modelled projections, we take the MIX scenario which better reflects the current policies in place.

We then take the growth rate of this revised projection for total CO2 emissions from WEO and apply that to total GHG emission from the energy sector in 2022 and extend out to 2035. Non-CO2 emissions represent about 3% of energy sector emissions, so we think WEO is a good proxy for the entire sector. For all other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 WEM scenario to extend each sector out to 2035 individually.

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Planned policy projections

We provide a range of projections for the EU’s planned policies.

To develop a planned policies projection for the bottom of the range (i.e. maximum emission reductions), we modified our energy sector estimate to take into account the 45% indicative RE target, up from the 42.5% included in our current policy projections’ lower bound. For the other sectors, we use sector-specific growth rates from EEA’s 2023 ‘with additional measures’ (WAM) scenario to extend each sector out to 2030 individually.

To devise the modified energy sector estimate, we took the energy emissions projections from the lower range of our current policy projection and multiplied it by the ratio between projected total energy emissions in 2030 with a 42.5% RE binding target compared to a 45% RE indicative target. We interpolated the data between total energy emissions in 2022 to this adjusted value for 2030 to complete the timeseries.

To calculate the ratio indicated above, we started with the 2030 emissions estimates provided by the European Commission in its initial modelling of the higher emissions reduction goal published in 2021 (European Commission, 2021c). We select the MIX scenario for the 2030 domestic energy related CO2 emissions (i.e. excluding international aviation and shipping). This modelling assumed a renewable energy share of 40% and when corrected to remove international bunkers, assumes a final energy consumption of 751 Mtoe.

We calculated the emissions intensity for energy CO2 emissions and then adjusted this figure to reflect the higher renewable energy share adopted by the EU (42.5% and 45%). To calculate energy CO2 emissions we used this revised emissions intensity value and the Energy Efficiency Directive’s final energy consumption target of 11.7% below the 2020 EU Reference scenario we which calculate to be 726 Mtoe, excluding international aviation in 2030.

We used the 2021 ratio between energy CO2 and all gases to estimate total emissions in 2030. For the other value in the ratio, we applied the same methods as indicated earlier but used the indicative additional target included in the Renewable Energy Directive of 2.5% (or 45% share total).

To develop a planned policies projection for the upper end of the range (i.e. minimal emission reductions), we take the projected GHG emissions under the S3 scenario from the 2040 target communication impact assessment by the European Commission (in AR5) and convert it to AR4 while at the same time removing the influence of international aviation. In the EU’s Fit for 55 modelling scenarios, international aviation is included in the final energy consumption and GHG emissions (European Commission, 2021b). To omit it, we subtract the international aviation energy consumption and GHG emissions from the totals.


## Proposed 2040 target

We take the EU’s modelled 2040 target from the S3 scenario presented in its impact assessment (European Commission, 2024b). We substitute the emissions from LULUCF in AR5 GWP and also excluding indirect CO2 emissions and emissions from international aviation. We exclude the LULUCF emission but add in the planned assumptions for industrial carbon removals which include Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACCs) and Bioenergy Carbon Capture (BECCs). Regardless of scenario industrial removals are set at 75 MtCO2e. Finally, we convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990.

This results in an emission reduction of 86% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels. We then apply the range of LULUCF assumptions (215, 317 and 376 MtCO2e) to determine the resulting emission reductions percentages from 1990. Building on the 85% baseline emission reductions, the added LULUCF options would resulting in 90%, 92% and 94% emissions reductions.


## Net-zero target

In December 2018, the European Commission published its assessment of the climate neutrality goal by 2050 for the EU28 (European Commission, 2018a, 2018c, 2018b). In 2024, as part of the EU’s 2040 target proposal’s Impact Assessment (European Commission, 2024b), new data was made available on the emission projections to 2050. Out of the four scenarios, we take the S3 scenario which best reflects the likely pathway the EU has indicated it will strive for.

We take the GHG emission in 2050 (excluding LULUCF) in AR5 and add in the assumed industrial carbon removals from DACCs and BECCs from the 2040 Target Impact Assessment. We provide a single projection and not a range based on the S3 scenario in the 2040 target impact assessment. This approach reflects what the EU Commission said it will pursue. We convert the value from AR5 to AR4 using a conversion factor based on emissions in 1990 to get 295 MtCO2e as our target excluding LULUCF.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).

Some of the EU data used in our calculations is based on AR5 values. Please see the individual sections above for our conversion methods.
