# Summary


## Overview

**While its greenhouse gas emissions have fallen to their lowest since 2013, Japan is still set to miss its 2030 target if it does not implement more ambitious policies. The government’s climate agenda** **continues to place more emphasis on economic growth and energy security, rather than ambitious decarbonisation efforts. Japan’s latest Green Transformation strategy, the GX Basic Policy, does not provide concrete emissions reduction targets; instead, it promotes the development of so-called “clean coal” technologies in the power sector, a move inconsistent with pathways required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C.**

**The government plans to update both its NDC and Basic Energy Plan. The new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, should seize this opportunity to prioritise the scale-up of renewable energy and move rapidly away from coal once and for all. The CAT continues to rate Japan’s overall climate targets and action as “Insufficient”.**

Japan’s 2030 emission reduction target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement and remains “Insufficient”. Japan aims to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030 below 2013 levels (and 50% below as an aspirational target), a target that still falls short of the more than 60% reduction below 2013 levels that a CAT analysis estimates as 1.5°C-compatible.

The GX Basic Policy suggests the government is still reluctant to take the measures necessary to decarbonise its economy and achieve net zero emissions by 2050, as would be implied by its current net zero target. The new strategy provides no details on the expected emission reductions for 2030 and 2050. There are also concerns that the carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes envisioned by the government will not be effective in reducing Japan’s emissions. It remains unclear whether the emissions trading scheme planned for 2026 will still be based on voluntary participation, and the carbon levy, which will only be implemented in 2028, is expected to be set a low level.

In a significant policy shift, Japan has unveiled plans to build new generation nuclear reactors, as part of the GX Basic Policy. Despite this reversal, many regulatory and economic hurdles to new nuclear reactors remain, making it unlikely that they will be operational before 2035-2040. Renewable energy deployment continues to take a back seat, as the government prioritises nuclear energy expansion and the development of so called “clean coal” technologies.

The GX Basic Policy also puts a strong emphasis on the need to develop Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, and ammonia and hydrogen co-firing in the power sector, in Japan and overseas. However, these technologies would not be needed to decarbonise Japan’s energy sector if Japan fully harnessed the potential of its renewable energy sources, which are much cheaper in comparison and have a much lower environmental footprint.

In April 2024, G7 countries agreed to phase out unabated coal power generation by 2035, an unambitious timeline for developed countries which should aim for a 2030 phase-out at the latest. The pledge gives leeway to Japan to keep relying on coal power plants with ammonia co-firing power and “high efficiency” coal power, which cannot be considered "abated" coal.

The Japanese government is pushing for continued investment in upstream fossil gas and LNG, claiming it can be a transitional fossil fuel. Japan is also advocating for further development of LNG infrastructure in other countries, to sustain its large flow of imports. However, such investment further contributes to locking in carbon-intensive developments: Recent scientific literature highlights that there is no room for investment in new oil, gas, and coal activities if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C, and such investments are in stark contrast to what is needed to meet Paris Agreement goals.

In policy documents, the Japanese government consistently uses terms such as “clean coal”, “green transformation”, “electrified vehicles” and “clean hydrogen”. However, these terms are undefined, often misleading and strengthen a harmful narrative, serving as a smokescreen to hide the government’s intention to keep relying on fossil fuels.

Japan’s GHG emissions fell to a record low in 2022, mainly due to reduced energy consumption in the industry and commercial sectors. Without additional measures, Japan’s current policies and actions will lead to emission levels of 31% to 37% below 2013 levels in 2030, excluding LULUCF. This falls short of Japan’s NDC target, let alone the 60% below 2013 levels in 2030 needed to be in line with keeping warming below 1.5°C.

The government is currently in the process of drafting its 2035 NDC and its Basic Energy Plan, which is the overarching document governing Japan’s energy policy. To improve its climate targets and action rating, Japan could:

- Commit to a full coal phase-out in a timeline consistent with pathways required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C
- Set new electricity mix targets for 2035 in the new Basic Energy Plan in line with the upcoming NDC target year
- Prioritise the scale-up of renewable energy capacity and strengthen related targets
- Strengthen its EV target to phase out all fossil-fuel passenger (ICE) cars from new sales by 2035.
- Stop public financing of fossil fuel projects overseas and stop the international promotion of “clean coal” technologies.
- Strengthen its 2030 target ambition level in line with the Paris Agreement
Despite Japan’s overall lack of ambition, there have been a few positive developments worth highlighting, including some sub-national actions:

- The adoption of the “Renewable Energy Installation Standards”, a regulation requiring construction companies to install rooftop solar panels on new buildings in Tokyo, from 2025.
- The amendment of the Act on Sea Area Utilisation for Renewable energy to accelerate the development of offshore wind power, particularly floating wind turbines.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

**The CAT rates Japan’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient”.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Japan’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

Japan is not meeting its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation. Japan would need to improve its rating by increasing the ambition of its domestic emissions target, as well as providing and mobilising increased levels of financial support for further emissions reductions in other countries.

We rate Japan’s NDC target as “Insufficient” compared to its fair share and its climate finance contribution as “Highly Insufficient”. While considering modelled domestic pathways, Japan’s domestic NDC target and its policies and action are rated as “Insufficient”.

To improve its rating, Japan should strengthen its domestic emissions reduction target adopt policies necessary to reach this goal, and significantly increase its support for climate action in developing countries in line with its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation.

**The CAT rates Japan’s policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Japan’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5 °C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

We project that Japan’s implemented policies will lead to emission levels of 31% to 37% below 2013 levels in 2030, excluding LULUCF, falling short of its NDC target to achieve 46% (42% excluding LULUCF credits) below 2013 levels. Without additional measures, Japan will likely miss its NDC target, let alone the more than 60% reduction below 2013 levels which we estimate as 1.5 °C-compatible.

The Green Transformation Basic Policy has failed to raise Japan’s climate ambitions. The strategy provides no details on the expected emissions reduction for 2030 and 2050 and prioritises nuclear energy expansion and the development of so called “clean coal” technologies. There are also concerns that the carbon pricing scheme envisioned by the government will not be effective in reducing Japan’s emissions.

The government’s focus on developing co-firing coal plants with ammonia and hydrogen and introducing the as-yet-unviable carbon capture and storage, are all distractions from the need for it to phase out coal-fired power by 2030 at the latest.

**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**

**The CAT rates the currently planned 2030 reduction target of 46% (42% excluding LULUCF) below 2013 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways**. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Japan’s NDC target against modelled domestic pathways needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The CAT rates Japan’s 2030 NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.** The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Japan’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C

Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of additional financial support for emissions reduction in developing countries. Japan’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**The CAT rates Japan’s international public climate finance contributions as “Highly insufficient”.** Japan remains committed to provide climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating Japan needs to stop funding fossil fuel overseas and accelerate commitments to increase climate finance.

Japan’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the NDC target against fair share rating, and the CAT rates Japan’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

**The CAT evaluates Japan’s net zero target as “poor”** because Japan does not provide sufficient details on key elements that ensure effectiveness and transparency of net zero targets.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate Japan’s net zero target as: “Poor”

Japan’s 2050 net-zero target was published in October 2020, which was subsequently integrated into the amended Promotion Act of Global Warming Countermeasures in 2021 (Government of Japan, 2021a). The Green Growth Strategy was accordingly revised in June 2021 to provide further information on sector-level roadmaps towards net zero, which was reflected on Japan’s updated Long Term Strategy submitted before COP26 (Government of Japan, 2021c).

However, these documents still lack several details on key elements that ensure effectiveness and transparency of net zero targets and thus have room for further improvement. For this reason, the CAT rates Japan’s net zero target as “Poor”.

Target covers all GHG emissions

The target excludes both international aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in law

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Non-legally binding process to review net zero target OR In process of establishing a review cycle for net zero

No transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals

Some information on the anticipated pathway or measures for achieving net zero is available, but with limited detail.

Country makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target


## CAT analysis of net zero target

- **Target year** – Japan aims to reach net zero 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The target excludes both international aviation and shipping but Japan recently committed to achieving net zero emissions both in international aviation and shipping at the recent ICAO and IMO meetings (see our international aviation and shipping sector assessments for further details).
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders **– Japan reserves right to use of international offset credits to meet its net zero target but the extent of this usage remains unclear.
- **Legal status** – Japan passed its net zero target in the amended Promotion Act of Global Warming Countermeasures on 26 May 2021. The net zero target is included in the Japan’s Long-term Strategy.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Japan provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – Japan has a legally-binding process under the Promotion Act to review the progress up to 2030 towards the net zero target in 2050 but reviewing the net zero target itself is not legally-bound as it is not enshrined in a law but only stipulated in policy documents.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Japan provides no information on its intention to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals. However, the Green Growth Strategy provides that the government will regularly review the prospects of new technologies which assumingly include CDR and other technological removal options (METI, 2021b).
- **Comprehensive planning** – While Japan’s net zero target and measures have been developed and described in its Green Growth Strategy as well as Long Term Strategy, its pathway to net-zero particularly after 2030 towards 2050 remains unclear. The absolute reductions as well as removal targets in 2050 are not clearly communicated.
- **Clarity on fairness of target **– Japan provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness, nor is the gap between realistic net zero target and a fair target explained.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## Announcement

**This is a short assessment of the Japan’s 2035 headline target announcement. Japan submitted its** **2035 NDC**** to the UNFCCC on February 18, 2025. The full analysis will follow shortly.**

As reported by The Japan Times and other media outlets, the joint governmental panel of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and Ministry of the Environment has proposed a new 2035 target of 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, compared to 2013 levels. This assumes a linear trajectory between Japan’s 2030 NDC target and the 2050 net zero target. While not yet officially endorsed or submitted by the Japanese government, this proposed 2035 target would significantly fall short of what is required to be 1.5°C compatible.

Recent analysis by the Climate Action Tracker finds a reduction of at least 81% by 2035 below 2013 would be needed in order to be compatible with 1.5°C-aligned domestic emission reduction pathways (see figure below). This finding has formed the basis of a recent expert statement by Japanese climate scientists, academics, and activists for an ambitious 2035 target.

Our analysis, which models 1.5°C-aligned pathways from 2020 onwards, shows that Japan will have drifted far away by 2030 from the 1.5°C-aligned pathways. For the 2035 NDC, the Japanese government must consider the way forward to make up for the delayed action, instead of using it as an excuse for continued lack of ambition and action in the future.

Moreover, as reported by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, a member of the governmental 2035 NDC formulation committee was stopped by the Ministry of the Environment from expressing his opinion for a more ambitious target. This highlights the issues around transparency and fairness of energy and climate policy deliberation processes in Japan.

The Climate Action Tracker will assess Japan’s 2035 target as part of its recently launched 2035 Climate Target Update Tracker once officially communicated by the Japanese government.


# Policies & action

**The CAT rates Japan’s policies and action against modelled domestic pathways as “Insufficient”.** This rating indicates that Japan’s policies and actions in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The CAT estimates that Japan’s implemented policies will lead to emission levels of 31% to 38% below 2013 levels in 2030, falling short of its latest NDC target of a 42% reduction below 2013 levels, both excluding LULUCF. Without additional measures, Japan will likely miss its NDC target, as well as the 60% reduction below 2013 levels target, the only one we estimate to be 1.5°C-compatible. In 2023, the government adopted the Green Transformation (GX) Basic Policy, a set of initiatives that aims to generate approximately JPY150 tn (approx. USD 1 tn) of public-private investment over the next 10 years (METI, 2023e). This new strategy seeks to ramp up decarbonisation efforts in key industrial sectors through the GX League, a voluntary group of industries who individually set their own decarbonisation targets to be in line with the national reduction targets and participate in an emissions trading scheme to achieve them (i.e. 46% emissions reduction in 2030 below 2013 levels and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050) (CAS, 2022; METI, 2022a).

As of March 2024, 747 companies which collectively account for 50% of CO2 emissions (including indirect emissions from electricity use in households) have joined the group (METI, 2024a). In 2024, as part of the GX basic policy, the Japanese government issued the world’s first sovereign transition bonds called the Japan Climate Transition Bonds. The first tranche was auctioned in February 2024.

However, the GX Basic Policy places more emphasis on economic growth and energy security, than on prioritising ambitious decarbonisation efforts. In fact, the new strategy does not provide any emissions reduction targets for 2030 or 2050. While it finally lays out a blueprint for the introduction of a carbon pricing scheme, there are concerns that the system envisioned by the government will not be effective in reducing Japan’s emissions. It remains unclear whether the emissions trading scheme currently being considered for 2026 will still be based on voluntary participation (InfluenceMap, 2023; METI, 2023d). On top of that, the carbon levy, which will only be implemented in 2028, is expected to be set at a low level (Renewable Energy Institute, 2023d).

There are also concerns that the GX Basic Policy will keep Japan wedded to coal, as it puts a strong emphasis on the need to develop CCS technologies, and ammonia and hydrogen co-firing, as tools to curb emissions in coal fired power plants. These technologies are all distractions from the need for Japan to phase out coal-fired power by 2030 at the latest.

Studies show that Japan could achieve between 80-90% of clean electricity share by 2035, thereby reducing its dependence on fossil fuel and bolstering its energy security (Renewable Energy Institute, 2024; Shirashi et al, 2023).

In a significant policy shift, Japan unveiled plans to build new generation nuclear reactors, as part of the GX Basic Policy. Despite this policy reversal, the first turn toward nuclear power since the Fukushima disaster, many regulatory and political hurdles remain, and it is unlikely that the new reactors will be operational before 2035-2040.

One policy expected to contribute to significant additional reductions, though its effects would only take place in the long-term, is the revision of building standards by which all new houses and buildings will need to comply with upgraded energy efficiency standards from 2025 (MLIT, 2022). This is a significant step forward as the emissions from the buildings sector increased by 34% in 2020 above 1990 levels while Japan currently aims to achieve 28% emissions reduction in 2030 below 1990 levels. (GIO, 2022; Government of Japan, 2021b).

To also support decarbonising existing houses and buildings, several measures have been introduced including financial support for house renovations to improve energy efficiency as well as promoting the use of renewable energy in buildings (MLIT, 2022). Japan aims to achieve on stock average net-zero energy consumption for newly constructed buildings (ZEBs) and houses (ZEHs) by 2030 as well as all buildings and houses by 2050 (MLIT, 2022). Additionally, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has mandated majority of new buildings and houses to install solar panels from 2025 (The Japan Times, 2022b)

The table below illustrates the fuel mix in the power sector in 2022, and the different assumptions for our projections, in comparison to the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2023 (IEA, 2023) (See Assumptions tab for details).


## Power sector

With its latest Basic Energy Plan, Japan currently aims to supply electricity from 36–38% renewable electricity, 20–22% nuclear, 20% gas and 19% coal in 2030 (METI, 2021a). While the indicated share of decarbonised electricity is roughly in line with our 1.5oC benchmark (though at the lowest end), keeping 19% of coal-fired power generation is completely inconsistent with the virtually full coal phase-out needed by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2021; IEA, 2021). Additional measures are certainly necessary also to achieve a full or predominant decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2035, a goal Japan committed as a member of G7 in April 2023(G7, 2023).

Nuclear power’s role in Japanese future energy mix remains uncertain, after all reactors were shut down in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. As of 14 March 2024, 25 reactors in 15 nuclear power plants have applied for a restart (plus two in construction applied for operation); 17 reactors with a total of 17 GW have passed the safety examination and have been approved for restart (under the condition that the plans for the construction work are approved by neighbouring local governments and the required safety measures are properly installed), of which 12 are currently in operation (JAIF, 2024).

In 2022, in a significant policy shift, Prime Minister Kishida announced that Japan will move to re-start the currently idled rectors, and build new generation reactors, as part of the GX Basic Policy (Asahi Shimbun, 2023a; METI, 2023d). A recent amendment has also allowed nuclear reactors to operate beyond their 60-year age limit. Under the new system, the time during which reactors are offline due to inspections, construction or legal actions, would be excluded from their total lifespan, therefore allowing them to be operated beyond the current limit (Nikkei Asia, 2023a). The new system will come into effect in June 2025 (Nikkei, 2024a).

Despite this reversal, many hurdles remain, and nuclear power will not help Japan meet its 2030 targets. Nuclear power plant operations will likely continue to be disrupted by unplanned inspections as well as legal action to stop them. There have already been several district court rulings to halt the operation of the restarted reactors (National network of legal teams for nuclear phase-out, 2023; Nikkei Asia, 2022a; The Japan Times, 2023).

While the Japanese public is increasingly in favour of expanding nuclear energy in the light of energy prices (Asahi Shimbun, 2023b), strong opposition remains, particularly among local governments hosting nuclear plants. To re-start a reactor or build a new plant, power companies must obtain the approval of local authorities, including all municipalities located within 30km2 of the facilities, which can take quite some time (Nikkei, 2022a). The construction of “next generation” reactors is also expected to face significant delays and cost overruns, like in other countries, making it unlikely that they’ll be operational before 2035-2040. The Japanese nuclear industry is also facing a shortage of engineers and manufacturers, which is straining the domestic supply chain (Renewable Energy Institute, 2023a).

We estimate, based on these developments, that the nuclear power share will range between 11% and 20% in 2030 (see Table 1, and also Assumptions tab). Our upper end estimate reaches the government target (20-22% in 2030).

Japan remains unambitious on coal. The 19% coal-fired power generation share in 2030, while a considerable step forward from the previous NDC target, is far from being 1.5oC-consistent.The Japanese government has no intention of fully phasing out coal and is instead focusing on promoting so-called “clean” coal technologies (METI, 2023f). The government plans to increase coal-fired power plant efficiency standards from 41% to 43% (METI, 2021d). It has also officially included thermal power with CCS as well as ammonia and hydrogen — most of which are currently produced from fossil fuels — as non-fossil energy sources to promote its use as decarbonised fuel (METI, 2022b).

The GX Basic Policy also puts a strong emphasis on the need to develop ammonia and hydrogen co-firing in thermal power plants (METI, 2023d). However, a recent report shows that ammonia-coal co-firing power would not be an economically viable option compared to renewable electricity (further description below, under **Hydrogen and ammonia**) (BloombergNEF, 2022; Kiko Network, 2021).

In April 2024, G7 countries committed to phase out unabated coal power generation by 2035 (G7, 2024). While this pledge has been hailed as a significant milestone, it leaves wiggle room for Japan by stating that countries could follow "a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5-degrees-Celsius temperature rise within reach, in line with countries' net zero pathways". The agreed 2035 timeline is also unambitious. According to the International Energy Agency’s net zero roadmap, developed countries like Japan should phase out coal by 2030 (IEA, 2021).

It is also important to note that power plants with ammonia co-firing power and “high efficiency” coal power cannot be considered "abated" coal. These technologies are inconsistent with pathways required to limit global warming to below 1.5°C.

Japan has also been a major funder of coal-fired power plants overseas, alongside China and South Korea (EndCoal, 2020). Japan has been the G20’s largest supporter of international fossil fuel projects through export credit agencies (DeAngelis & Tucker, 2020). Faced with mounting international pressure, Japan agreed at the 2021 G7 summit to end new public financing for unabated coal projects overseas by the end of 2021 (G7, 2021), and, at the 2022 Summit, further committed to end such financing also for other fossil projects overseas by the end of 2022 (G7, 2022; The Japan Times, 2022a). However, despite these commitments, Japan continues financing fossil gas projects overseas (Fossil Free Japan, 2023; Oil Change International, 2023).

While the private sector also shows signs of change, the actual divestment speed remains very slow (Reuter, 2023; Trencher et al., 2020). For example, despite the announcement of gradual divestments, Japan’s largest banks — Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC Group — still remain the top three lenders for global coal projects, financing a total of USD 61bn between January 2019 and November 2021 (Urgewald, 2022). These same banks are among the world’s top five banks supporting metallurgical coal expansion (Reclaim Finance, 2023).

CCS technologies are playing an increasing role in Japan’s decarbonisation strategy. Under a long-term roadmap for CCS, Japan currently aims to store 120-240 million tonnes of CO2 a year in 2050. To achieve this target, METI unveiled plans to raise its annual CO2 storage capacity by 6-12 million tonnes every year from 2030 (Reuters, 2023a).

The ministry has identified 11 potential storage sites in Japan with an estimated total capacity of 16 billion tones (METI, 2023c). The government expects CCS to play a large role in achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. However, CCS technologies are yet to become commercially viable and are not yet proven at scale despite large public subsidies for research and development. On top of that, there is no suitable location for CO2 storage in Japan nor oil fields for CO2 enhanced oil recovery, thus forcing the government to consider exporting large amount of CO2 to other countries (Renewable Energy Institute, 2022a). At a time where an increasing number of governments are committing to net zero emissions, Japan’s strategy risk drawing international criticism, while further deepening its energy reliance on other countries.

These polices are widely seen as a strategy to prolong the life of fossil-based electricity, in particular coal (JBC, 2022; Obayashi, 2022). The Japanese government indeed relies on CCS both to decarbonise thermal power generation and to supply hydrogen from fossil fuel sources (Renewable Energy Institute, 2022a).

Japan is the world’s second largest importer of fossil gas behind China. Gas makes up 34% of Japan’s electricity mix in 2022, a share that significantly increased following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent closure of all nuclear plants (IEA, 2023). Japan imports over 90% of its gas through 37 LNG terminals and boasts the world’s largest storage capacity (IEA, 2022).

The government is pushing for continued investment in upstream fossil gas and LNG, claiming it can be a transitional fossil fuel. However, domestic gas demand has been declining in recent years, with LNG imports at their lowest in over a decade (Reuters, 2024). Gas is not a transitional fuel, as confirmed by the IEA in its latest scenarios.

Japanese power utilities, unable to absorb the large volumes of imports, are actively promoting demand for fossil gas in other countries with a view to resell their surplus (IEEFA, 2024). The government has been encouraging Japanese companies to continue trading large LNG volumes and offload them in emerging markets, notably through the Asian Zero emission Community initiative (AZEC) (METI, 2023a, 2023g). Such a strategy further contributes to locking-in carbon-intensive developments: fossil gas needs to be phased out, globally, to keep warming to 1.5˚C.

Renewable electricity generation has grown steadily in recent years. The share of renewable energy in total electricity generation in Japan has increased from 10% in 2010 to 21% in 2022, with 10% coming from solar PV and 1% from wind energy (IEA, 2023). While there are other supplementary measures (such as subsidies for installing renewables in buildings described below, under **Buildings**), the 2012 Renewable Energy Act remains the main policy to achieve Japan’s renewable electricity share target of 36-38% by 2030 under its latest NDC. It institutes a feed-in tariff (FIT), which was partially shifted to a Feed in Premium (FIP) for large-scale projects in April 2022, and general funding for distribution networks.

**Solar power**

The FIT/FIP has provided very favourable rates, particularly for solar PV, which led to a large increase in PV installations; by April 2022, 64 GW of solar PV was installed and operational as a result of the FIT scheme (another 13 GW was installed but not yet operational) producing 8% of electricity, against the targeted deployment of 104–118 GW (14–16% of electricity) by 2030 (METI, 2022e). It should be noted that 64 GW of solar PV was Japan’s previous target for solar power. Among the large emitters, Japan has one of the highest installed solar PV capacity per capita (Renewable Energy Institute, 2022c).

**Wind power**

Despite its large potential, Japan lags behind other large emitters in terms of wind power, which only produced 1% of electricity in 2022 (IEA, 2023). As a measure to accelerate its development, a new law entered into force to facilitate the use of maritime areas for offshore wind power generation (METI, 2019a).

The government has an aspirational target to develop 10GW of offshore wind by 2030 and 30-45 GW by 2040. While we do not consider this target in our emissions projections as it is not included in Japan’s NDC, we estimate it could lead to an additional renewable electricity generation of 26 TWh/year or 2.5% of total electricity generation in 2030, assuming a 30% capacity factor. However, it should be noted that 10 GW for 2030 target is for approved projects under development rather than operational capacity. The government is targeting 5.7 GW of offshore wind operational capacity by 2030 and will likely meet this target (Renewable Energy Institute, 2023b).

Two rounds of auctions for large-scale offshore wind projects (3.5 GW in total) have taken place since 2022. A third was launched in early 2024 for two projects off the coast of northern Japan, totalling 1.05 GW (Nikkei, 2024d).

To accelerate the development of offshore wind power, particularly floating wind turbines, the Japanese Cabinet recently amended the Act on Sea Area Utilisation for Renewable energy. This will allow developers to build offshore wind farms in Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), specifically in “promotion zones” designated by METI (METI, 2024b). Currently, offshore wind development is limited to Japan’s territorial waters, which are managed by prefectural governments, whereas the EEZ is controlled by the national government.

Japan shows a strong commitment to develop hydrogen as a major decarbonised fuel. In 2017, it was the first country to formulate a Basic Hydrogen Strategy, which was revised in June 2023. Japan currently aims toboost its annual supply of hydrogen to 12 million tonnes by 2040 (METI, 2023h). The government plans to set up a JPY 15tn investment plan over the next 15 years and is also seeking to develop a hydrogen value chain via Australia, the Middle East and Asia (METI, 2023i).

Two of the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facilities are located in Japan in Fukushima (10 MW) and Yamanashi (16MW) (METI, 2022d). Australia’s national hydrogen strategy also identifies Japan as a potential major importer of Australian hydrogen (COAG Energy Council, 2019). An Australian-Japanese coal-to-hydrogen pilot project transported liquefied hydrogen for the first time in the world on February 2022 and aims for commercialisation by 2029 (METI, 2022d).

Through its new strategy, METI hopes to position Japan as a leader in “clean hydrogen”. However, that term is misleading as it seems to refer to blue, grey and green hydrogen (METI, 2023i).

METI has been relatively colour blind in its investments, prioritising grey and blue hydrogen over green hydrogen development (METI, 2017, 2019b; Renewable Energy Institute, 2022b). It is important to note that without the successful development of CCS, which is not yet available at scale and is expected to remain costly in the future, blue hydrogen produced with fossil fuels will not contribute to reducing emissions.

The Green Growth Strategy highlights the potential role of ammonia in reducing GHG emissions (METI, 2021b). The document indicates, for example, the possibility of using a 20% ammonia blend with coal to reduce emissions in thermal power plants. JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, has already set up a plan to create a pilot programme with the intention of using this blended fuel by 2035 (JERA, 2020).

The GX Basic Policy also promotes the development of ammonia and hydrogen co-firing in thermal power plants (METI, 2023d). However, hydrogen and ammonia technologies are less developed, potentially more costly, and their emissions reduction potential is questionable (Gunia, 2022; Stocks et al., 2022), compared to commercially available low-carbon technologies that could be deployed at scale before 2030 and help Japan get on the right trajectory to achieve its 2050 net zero goal.


## Industry

CO2 emissions from the industry sector (including indirect emissions from electricity use as well as emissions from industrial processes) accounted for 34% of Japan’s total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022 (GIO, 2024).

Within the industry sector, the iron and steel, chemical and cement industries are the three largest emitters, respectively emitting 39%, 15% and 8% of industrial emissions in 2021. Emissions in the sector have reduced by 20% below 2013 levels (GIO, 2023). A 2023 progress report shows that the industry CO2 emissions from the member companies of Keidanren, the most influential business association in Japan, including indirect emissions from electricity use in FY2022, was 20.8% lower than in 2013, and 3.7% lower than the previous year (Keidanren, 2024). The overall reduction since 2019 is primarily due the changes in industrial activity levels induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Following Japan’s economic recovery, emissions from electric use rebounded slightly in FY2021 but remained lower than in FY2019, as the effects of the pandemic continued to linger in key industrial sectors. CO2 emissions from the industry sector decreased again slightly in 2022 compared to the previous year mainly due to a decrease in iron and steel production (MOE, 2024).

The main GHG emissions reduction effort in the industry is Keidanren’s Commitment to a Low-Carbon Society (Keidanren, 2013), a voluntary action plan which has monitoring obligations under the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures (MOEJ, 2016b). Keidanren has since launched its Challenge Zero Initiative, in collaboration with the Japanese government, inviting companies to submit strategies to decarbonise their activities; a number of actors have already disclosed measures to be implemented, including in the steel and chemical industries (Keidanren, 2020).

Over 370 companies from the GX league have publicly announced their 2030 emission reduction targets. Combined, these aim for 40% reduction in 2030 compared to 2013 levels, falling short of the government 46% target (Nikkei, 2024b).

Among the industrial sectors that pledged to 2050 net zero goal is the iron and steel sector. The Japanese Iron and Steel Federation (JISF) announced in 2021 that it would aim to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 (JISF, 2021). JISF aims to cut emissions in the iron and steel industry, which is Japan’s largest CO2 emitter, by 30% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. Its stance on climate change seemed to have changed considerably since 2018, when it published a long-term decarbonisation vision that drew global emissions pathways reaching zero in 2100 to achieve the 2°C temperature goal (JISF, 2018). In 2021, CO2 emissions from JISF members were 16% below 2013 levels. However the majority of this reduction can be attributed to “production fluctuations”, namely decrease in production, rather than the adoption of sector specific mitigation measures (JISF, 2023).

Nippon steel, the largest steel-producing company in Japan and the fourth largest in the world, also released a decarbonisation road map in 2021. The company aims to develop and commercialise large electric arc furnaces by 2030 and expand the use of hydrogen in the sector (Argus Media, 2021; Nikkei, 2021). JFE Steel, Japan’s second largest steelmaker, has also announced plans to replace its blast furnace located in Okayama Prefecture with an electric arc furnace by 2027 (Nikkei, 2022c). However, the deployment of electric furnaces remain slow in Japan (Global Energy Monitor, 2023).

Other key industry associations have also unveiled new decarbonisation strategies. In 2022, the Japan Cement Association announced that it will aim to cut emissions in the sector by 15% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels (METI, 2022c).

The GX Basic Policy set roadmaps covering key sectors of the Japanese economy including the chemical, the iron and steel and the cement industries. These roadmaps introduced several targets, although many were already announced by industry associations in 2022 (METI, 2023d). One new target includes the increase of green steel supply to 10 million tonnes by 2030, although the exact definition of green steel remains unclear. It should however be noted that 10 million tonnes only represented around 1% of Japan annual steel production in 2021 (World Steel Association, 2022).

In December 2022, the Japanese government unveiled a blueprint for the introduction of a carbon pricing scheme, as part of the GX Basic Policy (METI, 2023e). This system will be based on two pillars:

- A carbon levy targeting power, gas, and oil companies, which will be introduced in 2028 and reviewed upward annually.
- An emissions trading scheme (ETS), which is being implemented in phases.
The ETS was first launched in April 2023 but only among the GX league companies. The scheme was set up on a voluntary basis with GX League companies allowed to set their own emissions caps. Based on the results of this trial, the government aims to expand the scheme to cover more companies in 2026. The scope of the target companies and the exact features of the ETS remain to be determined (MoEJ, 2023).

As for the final phase, the government plans to introduce the ETS “fully” in 2033, with a shift to a mandatory scheme that will include trading based on allowances auction. However, it will exclusively target the power sector (Nikkei, 2023), and no other sectors of the Japanese economy. The government plans to use the revenues generated by the carbon pricing scheme to issue more ”Japan Climate Transition Bonds”, the world’s first sovereign transition bonds, through which it hopes to raise JPY 20 tn (METI, 2023d). The first tranche of these bonds was auctioned in February 2024 (MoF, 2024).

Details on the overall system have yet to be announced, but the carbon levy is expected to be set at around JPY 1,500 /t-CO2, which is seen as too low to be effective (Climate Integrate, 2023). Research shows that with a carbon price set at JPY 3,300/t-CO2, new solar PV energy and onshore wind power generation would outcompete coal-fired power generation (Carbon Tracker, 2022).

This blueprint constitutes a step in the right direction, as discussions on carbon pricing in Japan have stalled for many years. However, it remains unclear whether the emissions trading scheme being considered for 2026 will still be based on voluntary participation (InfluenceMap, 2023). Additionally, the timeline and the carbon levy currently being considered by the government means the scheme will not help Japan meet its 2030 target. On top of that, the government is considering investing the revenues generated from the “GX Transition bonds” partly in the development of grey hydrogen and grey ammonia, rather than renewable energy (Renewable Energy Institute, 2023c).


## Transport

CO2 emissions from the transport sector accounted for 18.5% of Japan’s total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022 (GIO, 2024). Regarding vehicle decarbonisation, the government currently aims for 100% of “electrified vehicles” – a category that includes non-plug-in hybrids (HVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHV) – in the sale of passenger vehicles by, latest, 2035 (METI, 2020), replacing the previous target of reaching 50-70% of ‘new generation’ vehicles (including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, fuel cell electric vehicles, as well as ‘clean diesel’ vehicles and gas-powered vehicles) in the share of sales by 2030 (METI, 2018b). This policy, which still allows for non-plug-in HVs to be sold in 2035, could be further strengthened to become consistent with the 1.5°C-compatible benchmark to phase out all fossil-fuel passenger (ICE) cars from new sales by 2035 (Kuramochi et al., 2018). Japan’s commitment to transition away from ICE vehicles could further impact the global car manufacturing sector. Given the importance of the industry at both the national and international level, it could define a globally ambitious and innovative strategy favouring the development and deployment of zero-emission vehicles.

Additional pressure from investors has also started to impact car manufacturers’ strategies; Toyota for example, aims to launch 10 new EV models by 2026 and recently unveiled plans to build a battery plant in Fukuoka (Nikkei, 2024c; Nikkei Asia, 2023b). Honda aims to release 30 EV models by 2030 (Nikkei, 2022b). Nissan has also announced the launch of 16 EV models by 2026 and aims to achieve EV and ICE vehicle cost parity by 2030 (Nissan Motor Corporation, 2024).

However, despite these announcements, Japanese car manufacturers are still falling behind in the global race towards EVs. In 2020, Japanese cars only accounted for less than 5% of EVs sold worldwide (The New York Times, 2021). While EV sales in Japan increased by 50% in 2023 compared to the previous year, they only accounted for 2% of all new passenger car sales (Nikkei Asia, 2024).

Despite the mounting pressure to speed up electrification of the transport industry, Japanese carmakers are moving cautiously compared to their counterparts. Many in the industry remain wary about making the shift to electric vehicles and would rather keep investing in internal combustion engine manufacture.

For example, Toyota has recently announced that, while it will continue to ramp up its EV production capacity, hybrid vehicles will remain an important pillar of the company’s strategy (Reuters, 2023b). More recently, Toyota’s chairman, who retains significant power within the company, has renewed his scepticism towards EVs. He has openly doubted that the car industry would fully shift to EV, predicting they would capture 30% of the market at most (Bloomberg, 2024).

The GX Basic Policy did not set a more ambitious target for EVs. However, as part of the strategy, Japan plans to install 150,000 EV charging stations and 1000 hydrogen stations by 2030 (METI, 2023d), a positive development considering Japan is also lagging behind on EV infrastructure.


## Buildings

CO2 emissions (including indirect emissions from electricity use) from the commercial and residential building sectors together accounted for 32% of Japan’s total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2021 (GIO, 2023).

Compared to 1990, the emissions in these two sectors have increased by 42% and 19%, respectively (GIO, 2023). Although these significant increases are partially attributable to the increased electricity CO2-intensity post-Fukushima, there’s an urgent need for strengthened action on the demand side in the buildings sector.

An important recent development is the revised Building Energy Conservation Act, which entered into force in June 2022 mandating all new houses and buildings from 2025 to comply with upgraded energy efficiency standards. This is a significant step forward from the current regulation which is only applicable to buildings larger than 300 m2.

To also support decarbonising existing houses and buildings, several measures have been introduced, including financial support for household renovations to improve energy efficiency, as well as promoting the use of renewable energy in buildings.

Japan aims to achieve on stock average net-zero energy consumption for newly constructed buildings (ZEBs) and houses (ZEHs) by 2030 as well as all buildings and houses by 2050 (MLIT, 2022). This is a step change as in 2020, only 0.42% of newly built buildings was ZEBs, and 24% of newly built houses was ZEHs (METI, 2022f; METI & MOEJ, 2022). For comparison: the EU requires all new buildings to be near zero energy as of 2022.

The GX Basic Policy sets the objective to invest at least JPY 14 tn in the building sector over the next ten years (METI, 2023d).

In December 2022, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government also adopted the “Renewable Energy Installation Standards”, a regulation requiring construction companies to install rooftop solar panels on new buildings (including residential properties) of up to 2,000 m2, from 2025 (The Japan Times, 2022c). This new policy exclusively targets companies whose building projects total at least 20,000 m2 or more per year, so around 50 companies.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will set up thresholds per district, ranging from 30%, to 70 -85% of new buildings. The city will also provide subsidies to encourage the installation of solar panels on existing buildings, which are currently excluded from the regulation (Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2022). The “Renewable Energy Installation Standards“ is expected to be impactful, as half of existing buildings will be replaced with new ones before 2050.


## F-gases

CO2 emissions (including indirect emissions from electricity use) from the commercial and residential building sectors together accounted for 33% of Japan’s total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022(GIO, 2024).

Compared to 1990, the emissions in these two sectors have increased by 42% and 19%, respectively (GIO, 2023). Although these significant increases are partially attributable to the increased electricity CO2-intensity post-Fukushima, there’s an urgent need for strengthened action on the demand side in the buildings sector.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data were obtained from the UNFCCC GHG inventory and cover the period from 1990 to 2021 submitted in Common Reporting Format (Government of Japan, 2023a). The submission to the UNFCCC is supplemented by the National Inventory Report data file, which provides sector level emissions after allocation of electricity-related emissions to end-use sectors (Government of Japan, 2023b).


## NDC and other targets

The target emission level in 2030 provided in the updated NDC submitted in October 2021 is directly used in this assessment.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The Japanese government provides no underlying assumptions on its 2050 net-zero GHG target. For this reason, we assumed that GHG emissions will balance LULUCF sinks in 2050. We estimate the LULUCF sink for 2050 to be 28–61 MtCO2e using a 10-years historical average between 2009–2019 (upper bound estimate) and a 10-years trend projection towards 2030 based on the period between 2009–2019 that we keep constant towards 2050 (lower bound estimate).


## Current policy projections

For the analysis of current policy projections, we used the IEA World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2023 Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) as a basis (IEA, 2023). The WEO STEPS reflects both implemented policies as well as announced policies (see Annex B.6 of WEO 2023); only for the power sector the electricity mix targets of the updated NDC and the 6th Strategic Energy Plan (METI, 2021c) were assumed to be fully achieved.

Since it is premature to assume that the 2030 electricity mix targets would fully be achieved, we explored different shares of renewable and nuclear power generation based on historical trends, estimates by external studies, and current status of nuclear reactor safety examinations. CO2 emissions from the power sector were re-calculated based on the low and high emission electricity mix cases described below.

In the **low emissions** **case**, we assumed that:

- The WEO2023 STEPS scenario projections will be fully achieved, which means that:Nuclear power generation share will reach 20%, the lower range of the 2030 target. The nuclear capacity in operation will reach 30 GW, which will be larger than the total of 25 reactors that have applied for restart and two reactors under construction that applied for future operation to the Nuclear Regulation Authority as of March 2024 (JAIF, 2024).  Coal and oil power shares are kept to the NDC target (coal: 19%, oil: 2%). Renewable electricity generation reaches 385 TWh/year in 2030. The resulting share in total generation is 37 %, thus reaching the 36-38 % target. Gas power share is at 20%.
- Nuclear power generation share will reach 20%, the lower range of the 2030 target. The nuclear capacity in operation will reach 30 GW, which will be larger than the total of 25 reactors that have applied for restart and two reactors under construction that applied for future operation to the Nuclear Regulation Authority as of March 2024 (JAIF, 2024).
- Coal and oil power shares are kept to the NDC target (coal: 19%, oil: 2%).
- Renewable electricity generation reaches 385 TWh/year in 2030. The resulting share in total generation is 37 %, thus reaching the 36-38 % target.
- Gas power share is at 20%.
In the **high emissions** **case**, we assumed that:

- All 27 reactors that have applied for restart (or future start of operation for plants under construction) as of March 2024 will be in operation by 2030 but only at the capacity factor of 49% (the 2021 level), taking into account the possible court cases and unplanned inspections. The resulting share in total generation is 11%.
- Oil power shares kept to the NDC target (2%).
- Renewable energy share reaches 315 TWh/year in 2030, based on the reference scenario for Japan included in the 2022 APEC Energy Demand and Supply Outlook (APEC, 2022). The resulting share in total generation is 30%, falling short of the 36-38% target.
- Gas and coal power meets the remaining demand with equal shares, leading to 26% share each.
After the recalculation of the 2030 electricity mix, CO2 emissions in 2030 were recalculated— CO2 emission factors per technology were assumed to be identical to those in the WEO 2023 STEPS.

The projections for Industrial process CO2 emissions were based on the growth rates between 2020 and 2030 from the IEA WEO 2023 STEPS, multiplied by the 2020 emissions from the UNFCCC GHG inventory (Government of Japan, 2023b; IEA, 2023).

Agricultural & waste CO2 emissions were extended to 2030 using the trend of emissions intensity per GDP and per capita between 2011-2021 (UN DESA, 2022; World Bank, 2023).

Other non-CO2 emissions were extended to 2030 using the trend of emissions intensity per GDP and per capita between 2011-2021 (UN DESA, 2022; World Bank, 2023).

For F-gas emissions, the expected impacts of the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons (2013 amendment) to enhance management of F-gas use as well as the Ozone Layer Protection Act (‘F-gas Act’, 2018 amendment) to regulate the production and imports of F-gases to comply with the Kigali Amendment were considered. Our calculations show that the HFC emission levels are projected to fall far short of the levels targeted under the updated NDC.

As described in the current policy projections section, the F-gas Act has not been successful in improving the recovery rate of refrigerants from end-of-life refrigeration and air conditioning equipment which was 41% against the targeted rate of 50% in 2020 (METI & MOEJ, 2021b). The recovery rate even dropped to 40% in 2021 (MoEJ, 2022). Based on the historical trends reported by MOEJ (MoEJ, 2022), we assume that the HFC recovery rate will not improve over time. We also assume that the leakage rates for the in-use stock will also not improve under current policies. Regarding the 2018 amendment of the Ozone Layer Protection Act, the business-as-usual consumption levels are projected to be below the Kigali cap at least until 2025 (METI, 2018a): the Kigali cap for Japan becomes significantly lower only in 2029. Since there is some time lag between consumption and emissions, we assume that the amended Ozone Layer Protection Act will not affect the HFC emission levels up to 2030.

The point of departure for the revised F-gas emission projections is the business-as-usual (BAU) projections provided in the background document of the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures (MOEJ, 2016a) – the Plan projects F-gas emissions to increase from 39 MtCO2e/year in 2013 to 77 MtCO2e/year in 2030 under a BAU scenario. The three measures: (i) enhanced recovery from end-of-life equipment, (ii) avoidance of leakage from in-use equipment, and (iii) switch to lower GWP F-gas and non-F-gas refrigerants are expected to reduce emissions to the NDC target level of 29 MtCO2e/year in 2030. In our assessment, we assume that only part of the NDC implementation plan, i.e. the switch to lower GWP F-gas and non-F-gas refrigerants, would be achieved.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).


# Targets


## Target Overview

With the latest NDC submitted on 22 October 2021, Japan aims to achieve a 46% (50% as aspirational target) emissions reduction including LULUCF by 2030 below 2013 levels. The CAT rates this target as “Insufficient” when compared to required domestic efforts, and “insufficient” when compared to Japan’s fair share.


## NDC Updates

Japan has not updated its NDC since the major update submitted in October 2021.In this NDC update, Japan strengthened its target to a 46% (42% excluding LULUCF) reduction in 2030 below 2013 levels from the previous 26% target. This would lead to absolute emissions of 813 MtCO2e/year, compared to 1079 MtCO2e/year with the previous target (sum of sector- and gas-level targets), both excluding LULUCF (Government of Japan, 2021b). The government planned to investigate additional measures that could lead to a 50% reduction.

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

Japan has indicated that it may use market mechanisms to achieve its target but has not provided sufficient details on the extent of such usage. In the absence of the clarity on the extent of usage, we have rated its NDC target against both global domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

**The CAT rates the proposed 2030 reduction target of 46% (42% excluding LULUCF credits) below 2013 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.** This rating indicates that Japan’s target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

NDC target against fair share

**The CAT rates Japan’s 2030 reduction target of 46% (42% excluding LULUCF credits) below 2013 levels as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.** This rating indicates that Japan’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C .

Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions reductions target itself, others could come in the form of additional financial support for emissions reduction in developing countries. Japan’s target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Japan’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

**The CAT rates Japan’s international public climate finance contributions as “Highly insufficient”.** Japan remains committed to providing climate finance in the period post-2020 but contributions to date have been very low compared to its fair share. To improve its rating Japan needs to further accelerate commitments to increase climate finance and stop funding fossil fuel overseas.

Japan reports significant levels of climate finance, but only a small share takes the form of grants or has climate as a primary objective (OECD, 2022). Japan also counts 50% of broader development projects as climate finance–- even though they are explicitly defined as not primarily targeting climate action (Carty & Kowalzig, 2022). The CAT accounted for these factors and the resulting finance considered in this rating is considerably lower than originally reported by the government.

Japan has contributed to the achievement of the USD 100bn goal yearly until 2020 and commits ‘to maintain the same level of amount beyond 2020’. However, it is important to note that the USD 100bn goal itself is insufficient post-2020. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance is thus fundamental in the post-2020 period. In this sense, it is positive that Prime Minister Kishida committed at COP26 to add USD 10bn for climate finance in general and USD 14.8bn for climate adaptation in particular (Reynolds, 2021). But more support is necessary.

Japan is still investing in international fossil fuel projects but is gradually moving away from this. At the G7 summit in 2021 and 2022, Japan joined the commitment to end new public finance of unabated coal power by the end of 2021, and of other fossil projects by the end of 2022 (G7, 2021, 2022). While Japan accordingly cancelled its involvement in the coal power projects in Indonesia and Bangladesh (Nikkei Asia, 2022b), the country is still one of the largest investors in fossil fuels abroad including its support for international oil and gas upstream developments (Christoph Bals, 2022; Kumagai, 2022).

In March 2023, Japan officially launched the Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) initiative, a cooperation framework to help Asian countries ensure energy security while striving towards decarbonisation (METI, 2023b).

Under the initiative, Japan will support countries in drawing up roadmaps for energy transitions and help them develop and implement “decarbonisation technologies”. However, these seem to also include carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies and hydrogen & ammonia co-firing, as ways to curb emissions in coal-fired power plants and gas-fired turbines/boilers (METI, 2023g). While these technologies have a role to play in the transition to net zero, they should only be used in hard-to-abate sectors, certainly not in the power sector, and particularly not as tools designed to curb emissions in coal-fired power plants.

Through the AZEC initiative, Japan is also pushing for further development of LNG infrastructure in the region, as the government seeks to position fossil gas as a transitional fuel (METI, 2023a). However, such investment would further contribute to locking-in carbon-intensive developments: fossil gas needs to be phased out, globally, by only a few years after coal, to keep warming to 1.5˚C.

## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate Japan’s net zero target as: “Poor”

Japan’s 2050 net-zero target was published in October 2020, which was subsequently integrated into the amended Promotion Act of Global Warming Countermeasures in 2021 (Government of Japan, 2021a). The Green Growth Strategy was accordingly revised in June 2021 to provide further information on sector-level roadmaps towards net zero, which was reflected on Japan’s updated Long Term Strategy submitted before COP26 (Government of Japan, 2021c).

However, these documents still lack several details on key elements that ensure effectiveness and transparency of net zero targets and have room for further improvement. For this reason, the CAT rates Japan’s net zero target as “Poor”.
