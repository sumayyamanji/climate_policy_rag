# Summary


## Overview

**The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential.**

**As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such,** **we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed** **from** **the new government’s climate action.** **We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025.**

**The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate.** **This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government.**

**The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country.**

A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030.

However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should:

- Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved.
- Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which:

- goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC,
- considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and
- sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms.
This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK.

However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration.

The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation pathways.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement**.** We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as "Almost Sufficient".

However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as "Insufficient".

Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased.

Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to "1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible" include:

- Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC.
- Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets.
- Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts.
We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context.

In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025.

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables.
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses.

However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

The full analysis of the UK’s policies and action is here.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being "Almost Sufficient" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway).

If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: The new UK government has yet to amend or update the UK’s existing net zero target. As such, the evaluation of the UK’s net zero target here refers to the existing targets and architecture set up by the previous government.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK and a delineation of separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases, including emissions from international aviation and shipping. The net zero target’s key strength is its periodic carbon budgets and associated intermediate targets: by means of five-year statutory carbon budgets, a clear timeline is provided that will facilitate the tracking of progress towards net zero.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

Target covers all GHG emissions

Target covers both aviation and shipping

Relies on international offset credits or reserves right to use them to meet net zero

Net zero target in law

No separate emission reduction and removal targets

Legally binding process to review the net zero target

Transparent assumptions or pathways for LULUCF and removals

Some information on the anticipated pathway or measures for achieving net zero is available, but with limited detail.

Some explanation on why the target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The UK aims to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (UK Government 2021b).
- **International aviation and shipping** –The Climate Change Act itself does not yet specify whether emissions from international aviation and shipping are included in the new 2050 target. However, the sixth carbon budget will count emissions from international aviation and shipping towards the UK’s emissions (UK Government 2021d). As the 2050 target will be achieved via carbon budgets, the inclusion of aviation and shipping in the sixth carbon budget suggests that the 2050 target will also account for international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – When introducing the net zero target in 2019, the Prime Minister’s office announced that the UK “will retain the ability to use international carbon credits […] to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation” (UK Government 2019b). However, around the same time, the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy specifically stated, in an answer given to a question in parliament, that the government did not intend to use international credits to achieve its net zero target (UK Government 2019a). Given the contradicting nature of official statements relating to this indicator, an “poor” rating has been assigned to the UK. However, this would be changed to a positive rating upon an official commitment to rule out the use of international credits, which was not present in the latest description of the UK's net zero targets (DESNZ 2023a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The UK’s 2050 target was enshrined in law in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The intermediate emissions targets, in the form of carbon budgets are also legislated for and legally binding. The UK has also submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy (UK Government 2021b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy includes several scenarios with varying levels of negative emissions in 2050 (UK Government 2021b), but does not set specific emissions reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – The UK has a legally binding process in place to review progress on achieving the net zero target (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee 2021). The Secretary of State is obliged to provide an annual statement on UK emissions trends, as well as a statement on whether each successive carbon budget has been met. There is also a provision that allows for the amendment of the 2050 target if there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change or in international law or policy.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** **–** In the Net Zero Strategy, the UK government has outlined the ranges of removals expected in 2050 from both bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). The Government aims to remove 75–81 MtCO2 by 2050 by these methods, which is more than suggested by the CCC (UK Government 2021b, CCC 2020). Updated estimates of 2050 carbon dioxide removal levels were not provided in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which considers only the period out to 2037.While transparent communication is to be welcomed, the UK’s target therefore displays a considerable reliance on removals, which could pose a delivery risk, due to the uncertainty around the technical feasibility of engineered CO2 removal (Grant et al 2021a). The Net Zero strategy does consider how CO2 storage potential could constrain carbon dioxide removal via BECCS and DACCS. This could represent a short-term constraint on CO2 removal in the 2030s (UK Government 2021b). The Government is working to develop CO2 storage infrastructure, including by developing a business model to incentivise the transport and storage of CO2.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy from October 2021 provides a range of sector-specific pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 (UK Government 2021b). The Climate Change Act’s legally binding carbon budgets provide a clear timeline that will help track progress towards net zero. In this way, the UK has some of the key elements of good practice in the area of comprehensive planning to reach net zero. The updated Carbon Budget Delivery Plan sets a new standard in transparency around the government’s plans to reduce emissions in line with net zero (DESNZ 2023a). This improved transparency, while welcome, has highlighted a large number of critical policy gaps in the UK’s pathway towards net zero. With only 24–32% of the necessary emissions reductions covered by credible policy, the UK’s current approach cannot be deemed credible, unless further action is taken (CCC 2023a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The CCC’s advice includes an assessment of the implications of different equity principles. The report concludes that the UK would have to do more than the world as a whole for its target to be considered ambitious and aligned fair share principles (CCC 2020). The report goes on to explain how the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target could be addressed. However, the Climate Change Act itself does not reference fairness nor equity in the context of its net zero target, neither does the Net Zero Strategy itself.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The UK’s 2035 target in its new NDC is ambitious and would translate to emissions below our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathway (MDP). Given that the 2035 target can also be reasonably achieved from the 2030 target, we label the UK’s new NDC as “1.5°C compatible” against MDPs. We welcome this proposed emissions cut for 2035 on the road to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and it is the first developed country to get this assessment.

At the same time, some key issues should be highlighted:

- First, the UK should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The UK’s current 2030 climate target of a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is very close to the 70% cut needed to align with these pathways. In 2023, UK emissions were estimated to already be 53% below 1990 levels. Updating the 2030 target could be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets also.
- Second, the UK should consider going beyond the minimum targets set by MDPs which are a floor, not a ceiling of ambition.
- While this 2035 target aligns with cost-effective pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically. The UK should therefore increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally, and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- What matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. The new government has inherited a vast implementation gap, with existing policies covering only 24% of the emission reductions needed to meet the new 2035 target. Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this new ambition into reality.
- The UK should not be developing new oil and gas resources and needs to progress its phase out of fossil fuels beyond coal. Leadership is badly needed on this issue globally and it is very bad signal if the UK follows the US Trump Administration on this issue.
The UK submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 30 January 2025 setting a target to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 keeping the same headline ambition that it announced at COP29. This target covers all sectors and all gases. With its 2035 target of 153 MtCO2e, the UK has closed the gap between its target and our 1.5°C compatible MDP in 2035 and gone slightly below the threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UK’s 2035 target is in the right ballpark for a cost-effective path to 1.5ºC. There’s also good detail on the current policy mix being implemented to cut emissions. We have the destination, and we have the tools to get there. What we now need is a detailed roadmap, breaking down sector by sector what the UK’s targets will be to achieve these emissions reductions. An updated net zero strategy will be published in “due course”, with full detail of policy packages across all sectors. The CAT is ready and waiting to evaluate this when it emerges.

The submitted NDC of 153 MtCO2e in 2035 is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is slightly below the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, however, the UK's its 2030 target of 253 MtCO2e is still slightly above the 236 MtCO2e threshold for 1.5°C MDP excluding LULUCF.

The 2035 NDC target includes detail on the actions being taken in different sectors to reduce emissions. This includes a commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, to achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030, and to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles via the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy. These plans align with the UK’s commitments under the Global Stocktake (GST).

The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with the CAT’s own power sector benchmarks, which found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Further information on the UK’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs that are at least aligned with globally cost-effective 1.5ºC pathways, and should communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.

Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. The UK has communicated that it intends to honour the commitment made by the previous government to spend GBP 11.6bn between 2021 and 2026, with at least GBP 3bn of this going to nature. This will be challenging, due to the systemic underspending on climate finance between 2021–2024, but is a welcome confirmation.

The UK then needs to commit to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026, as its 2030 and 2035 NDCs do not align with its fair share of global mitigation, and its provision of finance is currently rated as “Highly Insufficient."


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the huge emissions gap between current policies and a 1.5°C pathway. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The UK’s NDC fits within its institutional framework for planning, delivering and monitoring emission reductions. As such, it is a broadly credible document which demonstrates how planning and monitoring can help deliver on the commitments made.

However, planning and monitoring can only get you so far. Ultimately what is needed is action, and fast. The UK government inherited a vast implementation gap from the previous administration, with only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s NDC covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024). While the Government has made steps in addressing this, much more will need to be done.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The UK has often been a leader in the transparency of its communications to the UNFCCC. While this NDC provides a large amount of detail, the UK has missed the opportunity to provide clarity in three key areas: LULUCF, carbon removal, and carbon credits. The UK’s LULUCF emissions are very small compared to total emissions (at less than 1% of total emissions in 2022), and so the lack of clarity on LULUCF is perhaps less of an issue.

However, the UK has been criticised for relying too heavily on carbon dioxide removal in its long-term strategy and net-zero targets. In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.

# Policies & action

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The new government needs to take rapid action to develop and implement climate policies to reduce emissions. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emissions reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

The UK’s stalled progress in climate policy development over recent years means that, without immediate and rapid change, the UK can no longer be considered a leader in global climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The new government has strongly indicated that it intends to address this policy shortfall, introducing new funding and delivery mechanisms to close the gap. The CAT will be tracking these policy developments and provide an updated assessment of the progress made in 2025.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.


## Policy overview

The new government has inherited a challenging policy context. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays to key delivery mechanisms, rollbacks to other essential climate polices, and a clear lack of commitment to reducing emissions at the pace and scale needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. As a result, in July 2024, only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to reach the UK’s climate targets were covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024).

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind (DESNZ, 2024c) and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables (DESNZ, 2024a, 2024d).
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements (Seddon, 2024), has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (DESNZ, 2024b) (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest renewable auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is still not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise industrial electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentive industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. These policy rollbacks should be reversed.

## Power sector

The UK’s power sector crossed a milestone in October 2024 when the last coal-fired power station shut down. Rapid growth in renewables has phased out coal without increasing demand for fossil gas generation. In 2023, almost half of the UK’s electricity came from renewables, with a third of generation from wind and solar alone.

The focus must now turn to phasing out fossil gas. The UK has a target of achieving clean power by 2030 – this is a laudable goal which would put the UK at the forefront of the global power sector transition and demonstrate the viability of a fully decarbonised power sector to all.

**Coal**

The UK’s last coal-fired power station closed in October 2024, marking the end of an era. This historic moment puts the UK as a front-runner in the transition away from coal in the power sector, phasing out coal six years ahead of the 2030 deadline for developed countries (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

The UK’s coal exit is one of its main climate policy success stories of the past decade. As recently as 2012, coal provided 40% of the UK electricity mix (Ember, 2023). The rapid phase-out of coal means that power sector emissions fell on average by 10% each year between 2012–2022 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023).

**Fossil gas and oil**

The new UK government has a target to achieve “clean power” by 2030. While it has not provided the exact definition of clean power, this ultimately must involve phasing out fossil gas in the power sector. The CAT has found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with these benchmarks. Detailed modelling has shown that it is possible to push fossil gas out of the electricity system (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

It is unlikely that the UK will be able to fully phase out fossil gas in the electricity mix by 2030. However, it is possible to substantially cut gas demand. Detailed modelling highlights that the share of gas in the electricity system could fall to below 2% by 2030 without compromising security of supply (Ember, 2022). Keeping some of the fossil gas fleet as a “cold reserve” to provide very limited generation in periods of low renewable supply could help maintain energy security in the UK, while having a minimal impact on emissions. This fossil gas could then be fully phased out as alternative options to provide this back-up generation are deployed.

There is a wide range of options that can help balance a clean grid, including batteries, hydrogen, pumped storage, interconnectors and demand-side management. As such, fossil gas with CCS should play, at most, a minimal role in the power sector. Detailed modelling suggests that the UK could meet future electricity demand reliably in a grid dominated by wind and solar, with as little as 2.6 GW of fossil gas with CCS in the power sector in 2030, and only 0–5 GW by 2035 (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

Current CCS projects under development would be sufficient to reach this level. The UK should avoid embarking on a path of heavy reliance on fossil gas with CCS in the power sector, focussing instead on other measures to provide reliable zero-carbon electricity. Deploying turbines which can run on green hydrogen would be a key way to provide long-term flexible electricity generation without relying on CCS.

**Renewables**

The UK government is aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to support its goal of clean power by 2030 (Parkinson, 2024). Turbocharging renewables will be crucial to aligning with 1.5ºC, with the CAT finding that in the UK, the share of renewables in the power sector should reach 84–93% by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s goal of clean power by 2030 would align with this, depending on the exact assumptions made about the role of nuclear power in the electricity system.

Getting sufficient renewables capacity connected to the grid and generating before 2030 will be a herculean challenge. The UK has a range of policies to support renewables deployment. The central policy is the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme, which offers a guaranteed price to renewable generators over their lifetime, with the price set by reverse auctions. This has encouraged competition and innovation in the sector and driven large-scale investment and deployment. Wind capacity more than doubled in the past decade to 30 GW in 2023, while solar capacity grew from 3 GW in 2013 to 16 GW in 2022 (Ember, 2023).

However, as of July 2024, there were around 30 GW of offshore wind either in operation or in active development of some form (Ember, 2024). Given the lead time for offshore wind projects, this would mean that the 2024/2025 auctions would need to achieve over 20 GW of offshore wind deployment to keep the power sector on track for the 2030 goals (Ember, 2024). The 2024 auction achieved only 5 GW, putting offshore wind deployment in the UK significantly off track for the governments’ aims, and making the 2025 auction a critical policy milestone. Onshore wind and solar PV installation rates are also off track. The new government will need to move fast to try and address these issues and get renewables deployed at the pace and scale needed for its 100% clean power goal.


## Industry

The UK’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy introduced by the previous government (UK Government, 2021a) aims to reduce industrial emissions by two-thirds below 2018 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050. While emissions fell 3% in 2022 to 63 MtCO2e, they will need to fall much faster, by around 8% per year, to achieve the government’s climate targets (CCC, 2023a).

The strategy has a three-pronged approach: switching to low carbon fuels, efficiency gains, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). While some action is beginning to occur on fuel-switching, in particular in the electrification of steel, there remain significant gaps in the policies supporting resource efficiency in the industrial sector (CCC, 2024).

**Fuel switching**

In 2023, over 50% of industrial final energy was provided directly by fossil fuels (DESNZ, 2024c). This will need to be reduced substantially on the path to net zero. Two key options are the use of hydrogen, and direct electrification.

The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy sets a target of 50 TWh of fossil fuels to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives by 2035 in the manufacturing sector (UK Government, 2021a). This is roughly a third of industrial fossil consumption in 2022. To support this target, the previous government introduced the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme.

This is similar to the CfD scheme in the power sector, providing financial support to cover the additional cost of low-carbon hydrogen production. GBP 140m was allocated to support fuel-switching over 2023–2024. This provides a business model to support industrial fuel-switching to hydrogen and is a positive step. There is also a GBP 240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (DESNZ, 2023). While these funds are to be welcomed, they are much smaller than the scale of funds being offered in Europe to support hydrogen deployment (Abnett, 2023).

Industrial electrification has taken a step forwards in the UK, with the agreement of a deal to transform the Tata steelworks from a coal-fired blast furnace to an electric arc furnace producing recycled steel (H. Thomas & Browne, 2024). In November 2023, a similar decision was announced for the remaining blast furnaces operated by British Steel, although the planned switch date of 2025 may be set back due to grid connection delays (Gill, 2024). This marks a transition away from coal in steelmaking which will reduce emissions.

However, there has not yet been sufficient planning on how to ensure a just transition which preserves jobs in local communities dependent on steelmaking. This is a critical gap that must be addressed. There is also a need to drive industrial electrification in a more systematic way, with electricity prices still too high when compared to fossil gas (CCC, 2024).

**Carbon capture and storage**

The previous government set an aim of delivering 6 MtCO2/yr of industrial CCS by 2030, and 9 MtCO2/yr by 2035. This represents around 17% of total abatement in the industrial sector by 2035 (CCC, 2023a). The new government has continued this commitment to CCS, pledging GBP 22 bn of funding to drive CCS projects over the next 25 years (UK Government, 2024). Relying too heavily on CCS to deliver emissions reductions in the industrial sector could be risky, as the majority of previous CCS projects have ended in failure (Abdulla et al., 2020). In many sectors, the role and value of CCS is also being eroded as the cost of renewables declines (Grant, Hawkes, Napp, et al., 2021). CCS should be prioritised for applications where there are few alternatives, such as cement production (E3G, 2023).

**Fossil fuel supply**

Achieving the UK’s climate targets will require strong and sustained reductions in oil and gas production, as well as improvements to the emissions intensity of any remaining extraction. Oil and gas demand will need to fall around 30% by 2030 to achieve the UK’s NDC (CCC, 2020). The CCC also suggested that the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction should fall 68% by 2030, through electrification of processes and addressing fugitive emissions (CCC, 2020).

The previous UK government moved in the opposite direction, continuing to support new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, approving the Abigail, Jackdaw and Talbot fields (Oil and Gas Authority, 2023; A. Thomas, 2022; Tidman, 2022). New licensing rounds were held annually (UK Government, 2023a).

The incoming government has set a new direction, committing to end licensing for new oil and gas fields (Lempriere, 2024). This is a good start and should be welcomed. However, it does not address the substantial pipeline of projects which have already received exploration licenses and are either waiting for development consent or are already in production. There are thirteen such projects awaiting approval (Dunne, 2024).

The new government could strengthen its position on oil and gas by publicly committing to not approve this remaining pipeline of projects, and also set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals, for example joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).


## Transport

The transport sector is the largest source of emissions in the UK, representing 29% of emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Central to decarbonising transport is ending the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans by 2030 and fossil fuelled heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2035–40 (Department for Transport, 2021).

The policy context that the new UK government has inherited is mixed. On the one hand, the previous government confirmed the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2023, which sets minimum EV sales targets for each vehicle manufacturer and will be a key delivery mechanism in scaling up EV sales (UK Government, 2023b). At the same time, the government pushed back the date of the sales ban on internal combustion engine cars from 2030 to 2035, sending a very mixed signal to the public and automotive industry. In 2023, the share of electric car sales in the UK failed to grow, flatlining at 16.5% and falling off track for the UK’s transition for the first time (SMMT, 2024). The share of electric van sales is growing much more slowly and is significantly off-track (CCC, 2024).

Key actions for the new government should include:

- **Reinstating the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales**
- **Taking action to help accelerate EV rollout**. This should include removing barriers for the installation of EV chargers and working with major van fleet operators to understand barriers to EV uptake.
**Aviation**

In 2022, the UK released its Jet Zero Strategy which aims to reduce emissions from this sector to net zero (Department for Transport, 2022). This aims for domestic aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and total aviation emissions to reach net zero by 2050.

However, in this context, net zero does not mean eliminating the negative climate impacts of aviation, but rather allowing for a large-scale growth in emissions that would be compensated for via the UK emissions trading scheme, CORSIA and other offsetting mechanisms outside the aviation sector. The strategy also ignores the non-CO2 impact of aviation, which represents up to two-thirds of the sector’s overall climate impact (Lee et al., 2021).

The UK’s current strategy relies heavily on speculative technological innovation and carbon dioxide removal to enable a ‘net zero’ aviation sector, without addressing the elephant in the room – demand.

The previous government committed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would provide 10% of overall fuel use by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040 (UK Department for Transport, 2024). This is five times the level included in the CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway and would require an unprecedented scale-up of SAF production. The new government confirmed this commitment, and introduced a SAF mandate to drive this uptake (Department for Transport, 2024). There will also be a revenue certainty mechanism to provide confidence to investors seeking to build SAF plants to meet UK demand. However, SAF deployment remains very low globally and has consistently failed to meet expectations (Rutherford, 2022). Relying so heavily on this option therefore represents a major delivery risk.

The Jet Zero strategy also fails to address demand. The Government states that “the sector can achieve Jet Zero without the government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth” (Department for Transport, 2022), and envisages that passenger numbers could rise 70% from 2021 to 2050. This is in contrast to the CCC’s advice, which was that no net expansion in airport capacity should be permitted, and passenger growth should be 25% at most (CCC, 2020). Numerous airports are currently planning expansions or have received approval to expand in the past two years (AEF, 2022) which again could threaten the UK’s ability to achieve its climate targets. As yet, the new government has not provided any clear commitments that it will curb aviation demand, with the chancellor repeatedly mentioning aviation as a key engine of economic growth (Topham, 2024).

As a result, in 2050, the Jet Zero strategy expects that aviation will still be emitting around 19 MtCO2 per year, which will need to be compensated for by CO2 removal. Given the very limited potential for CO2 removal and uncertainties in the climate system, CO2 removal should be reserved to hedge against climate uncertainties and balance out truly hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g. from agriculture), rather than to facilitate a stark increase in aviation emissions in one of the world’s wealthiest countries.

For more information on the need to align aviation and shipping emissions with the Paris Agreement, see the sectoral pages oninternational aviation and international shipping.


## Buildings

Buildings were responsible for 20% of UK emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Emissions fell strongly in 2023 by 7.2% relative to 2022, due to reductions in gas demand (CCC, 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this was due to gas prices (which remain above the levels seen before the fossil gas energy crisis) or due to other drivers. Importantly, key indicators for tracking buildings decarbonisation, including the rate of heat pump installations and the rate of energy efficiency installations, are lagging far behind the level needed.

The number of heat pumps installed in 2023 increased only 4% from 2022 (CCC, 2024). The growth rate should be nearer 40–50% per year, if the number of annual installations is to reach 600,000–900,000 by 2030. Meanwhile the number of energy efficiency installations driven by government schemes fell in 2023, moving significantly off-track. This suggests that, without government action, the emissions reductions seen in 2023 will not be sustained into the future.

Priority actions for the new government should include:

- **Introducing a comprehensive programme for decarbonising public sector buildings**. Public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings represent a low-hanging fruit which could deliver substantial emissions reductions quickly.
- **Removing planning barriers to heat pumps**. The previous Government proposed such changes which would make it easier to install heat pumps (DLUHC, 2024). The new government should implement these changes immediately.
- **Re-introducing obligations for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented homes.** The new government has committed to do this in its manifesto – it must now turn this ambition into action.
- **Removing the exemption of 20% of houses from the fossil-fuel boiler installation phase-out**. The previous government introduced this exemption, suggesting that it would save money. However, maintaining the gas distribution network for such a small set of households would likely increase, not reduce costs.

## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for 12% of UK emissions in 2022 (DESNZ, 2024a). There has been essentially no progress made in agricultural decarbonisation over the past decade, with emissions in 2022 at the same level as in 2012.

In many places, the existing policy portfolio for agricultural decarbonisation is “too little, too late”. There is still no ban on the use of peat in gardening products, and plans to introduce methane-supressing feed products by 2030 are too late.

Key actions for the new government include:

- **Introducing policies to hedge against the risk of delivery failure**. The existing approach to agricultural decarbonisation has relied heavily on measures which are technological and voluntary in nature: this is a significant delivery risk. Productivity improvements on their own will not necessarily reduce emissions, with a risk that farmers simply increase herd numbers instead of freeing up land. Policies need to be developed to address these risks.
- **Introducing measures to** **address dietary change and food waste prevention**. The existing Government Food Strategy does not introduce measures to support and accelerate dietary shifts, despite the clear health benefits of doing so, and the evidence of consumer appetite for reduced meat consumption (Stewart et al., 2021; UK Government, 2022). The Food Strategy also only addressed food waste from large businesses, despite the majority of food waste occurring at the household, farm and supply-chain stages.
The UK has one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe, at 13% (Forest Research, 2023). The UK has set a target of planting 30,000 ha/yr of new woodland by 2025, which is aligned with the CCC’s recommendations. However, planting rates in 2023 were under half of this level (Forest Research, 2023).

It is essential that the new government takes action to accelerate tree planting. This will require new delivery mechanisms, complete with the required rates of funding. In particular, there is a need to provide clear long-term funding, and to streamline processes in order to draw in private capital.

Progress in protecting and restoring degraded peatland is also significantly off track. The Climate Change Committee recommends that over 60,000 ha/yr of peatland is restored from 2025 onwards. But in 2022/23, only 13,000 ha were restored – less than a fifth of recommended levels (CCC, 2023a). Key policy gaps include restrictions on the burning of peatland, as much peatland remains unprotected by current legislation, and a faster phase-out for peat in horticultural products, as the sale of peat will currently only be fully banned by 2030 (The Wildlife Trusts, 2023).


## Methane

14% of the UK’s total emissions in 2022 came from methane (DESNZ, 2024a), with 80% of these emissions coming from agriculture and waste. The UK is also a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, which sets a target of reducing methane emissions by 30% over 2020–2030. However, to date methane emission reductions are not happening fast enough in the UK. On average, methane emissions fell 0.9 MtCO2e/yr over 2015–2022. This would need to double to over 1.9 Mt CO2e/yr to reach the current 2030 targets.

Key actions for the government to take include:

- **Publishing plans to capture methane emissions** from landfill sites, as well as improving the monitoring of landfill emissions.
- **Develop plans to reduce methane emissions from agriculture**. This should include accelerating the deployment of methane-supressing feed products within the industry, as well as promoting measures to cut demand for meat and dairy.
- **Track, monitor and transparently report** on the UK’s progress towards the Global Methane Pledge.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data for 1990–2021 were obtained from the UK Government (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023a). Provisional emissions data for 2022 was also included to extend the time series to 2021 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023b). The UK provides inventory data to the UNFCCC that includes emissions from Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which are not covered by UK climate policy and are not included in government emission projections. For this reason, we have chosen to use national emissions statistics rather than UNFCCC inventory emissions.


## NDC and other targets

The UK’s 2030 NDC target of at least a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is expressed using 100 year global warming potentials (GWP100) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Government of the UK, 2022). In addition, the UK Government has specified that the target reference year includes F-gas emissions from 1995. Thus, to quantify the expected 2030 emissions, we apply the 68% reduction to a reference emissions level consisting of the UK’s emissions in 1990 but including F-gas from 1995 instead of 1990, all expressed in AR5 GWPs.

As the CAT presents all data across countries in GWP from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the 2030 emissions implied by the NDC target in AR5 GWPs are then converted back into AR4 GWP. This is done by calculating a historical conversion factor from AR5 GWPs to AR4 GWPs, using historical data from 2021. This conversion factor can then be used to calculate the NDC in 2030 in AR4 GWPs.

The UK’s 2030 (NDC) and 2035 (Sixth Carbon Budget) emissions targets includes LULUCF emissions. This needs to be subtracted for comparability with other countries. We use projections from the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget to estimate LULUCF emissions in 2030 and 2035 (CCC, 2020). While the government’s approach to achieving the NDC and Sixth Carbon Budget differs somewhat from the CCC, there is strong alignment on afforestation pledges, and so LULUCF emissions will likely be closely aligned with the CCC’s projections, if these targets are to be met.

The UK’s 2035 emissions target additionally includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. These emissions were added to the 1990 baseline when calculating what a 78% reduction would entail. Projected 2035 emissions from international aviation and shipping were then removed from the implied 2035 target, as these emissions are captured under our IMO and ICAO assessments and would be double counted if they remained as part of the UK’s total emissions. Data is taken from the UK’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (DESNZ, 2023a).

The UK’s 2050 net-zero target also includes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, which need to be removed. In the absence of long-term projections from the UK Government, we use the Sixth Carbon Budget to calculate LULUCF and international shipping emissions in 2050, while the high ambition scenario from the recent Jet Zero strategy is used to estimate aviation emissions in 2050 (CCC, 2020; Department for Transport, 2022).


## Current policy projections

NOTE: Current policy projections for the UK have not been updated since the September 2023 CAT profile. A new current policy projection will be quantified in 2025.

To estimate current policy projections, we use the 2023 progress report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC, 2023a). In this report, the CCC estimates the impact of current UK policies on emissions. Policies are ranked as ‘credible’, displaying ‘some risks’ to delivery, displaying ‘significant risks’ to delivery, or ‘insufficient’.

To calculate the upper range of the current policies trajectory, we take the impact of all credible policies. These are policies where there are proven delivery mechanisms, a credible combination of public/private financing and clear timelines in place. The resulting emissions savings come predominantly from the zero-emissions vehicle mandate to drive EV sales and the renewable electricity supply policies in the power sector. To estimate the lower end of the current policy trajectory, we additionally include the impact of all policies ranked as displaying ‘some risks’. These include policies around home decarbonisation, industrial CCS, hydrogen, and also some policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors.

The CCC estimates that in 2030, there are credible policies to cut emissions by 42 MtCO2e, relative to the baseline. Policies with some risks to delivery could cut emissions by a further 51 MtCO2e in 2030. This gives an emissions level in 2030 (converting to AR4 GWPs and removing international aviation and shipping and LULUCF emissions, all of which are included in the CCC’s estimates) of 340–394 MtCO2e.

The conversion from AR5 to AR4 GWPs is done in the same way as when calculating the UK’s emissions targets, by calculating the ratio between AR5 and AR4 GWPs for 2021. Future LULUCF and international bunker emissions are taken from the UK’s Net Zero Strategy (UK Government, 2021b).

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UK has set a target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target includes international aviation and shipping (IAS) emissions, as well as LULUCF emissions and removals from BECCS/DACCS (UK Government, 2019d). The CAT assesses IAS and LULUCF separately, and therefore these need to be removed from the projections.

The UK Government does not provide detail on the LULUCF emissions they assume in 2050. In the absence of this, we take analysis from the CCC, which suggested that in the Balanced Net Zero pathway which reaches net zero by 2050, LULUCF emissions would be -19 MtCO2/yr (CCC, 2020). We also use this source to estimate future emissions from IAS. In the Balanced Net Zero pathway, emissions from aviation and shipping in 2050 are 24 MtCO2. Assuming an equal split between international and domestic aviation/shipping in 2050 as in 2019, this means that in 2050, IAS emissions would be 19 MtCO2/yr.

Under these assumptions, the UK’s net zero target remains a 0 MtCO2e target in 2050 once LULUCF and IAS have been removed. However, in reality, the UK Government intends residual emissions to fall to around 70-80 MtCO2e/yr, with engineered removals from BECCS/DACCS offsetting these remaining emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In 2020, the UK updated its 2030 NDC to reduce GHG emissions by at least 68% below 1990 levels (including LULUCF and excluding international aviation and shipping). This is an increase on the previous target of a 57% reduction below 1990 levels. The UK also set a 2035 target to reduce emissions by 78% below 1990 levels including both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping. The CAT excludes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping from its analysis. Converting to this basis, the UK’s targets are to reduce emissions by 68% and 82% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 2035 respectively.

In 2019, the UK increased the ambition of its 2050 target to net zero GHG emissions (UK Government, 2019d).

*The CAT focuses on future emissions excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping (international bunker) emissions. The UK’s net zero target covers both LULUCF and international bunkers. The CCC’s path for reaching net zero by 2050 involves residual emissions of ~19 MtCO2e from international bunkers, and also a 19 MtCO2e sink from the LULUCF sector. These offset one another so that 2050 emissions remain at 0 MtCO2e. However, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions, with residual emissions from aviation and other sectors balanced by removals from LULUCF and engineered CO2 removal.


## NDC updates

**2030 NDC targets**

On 12 December 2020, the UK submitted its first updated NDC to the UNFCCC after leaving the European Union. This NDC commits the UK to reducing GHG emissions to 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. This represents a significant strengthening from the UK’s previous 2030 commitment, which was to reduce emissions by 57% below 1990 levels. The UK’s NDC is now aligned with its 2050 target of achieving net zero GHG emissions, according to analysis by the CCC (CCC, 2020).

The UK’s NDC is not fully aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways. This represents a downgrade from previous CAT analyses (from 2022 and earlier), due to the use of more recent global pathways aligned with 1.5ºC. A further strengthening of the UK’s NDC is therefore necessary to align with the latest evidence coming from least-cost modelled 1.5°C compatible domestic pathways. Strengthening the UK’s NDC would also better enable the UK to embody the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities that are central to the Paris Agreement.

Analysis has shown that an emissions reductions target of up to 70% (CCC, 2020) and towards 75% would be achievable (WWF, 2020). However, each day of delay makes achieving deep emission reductions much more challenging.

The UK revisited and updated its NDC on 23 September 2022 (Government of the UK, 2022). The UK did not strengthen the overall GHG emissions reductions target, as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 under the UK’s presidency. It did, however, provide a range of additional information to increase clarity, transparency and understanding.

This includes information on how the UK will deliver its NDC by 2030, how it will assess the NDC’s achievement, an update on the NDC’s territorial scope (which includes the Crown Territory of Jersey and Overseas Dependency of Gibraltar), and more information on how the UK’s climate targets relate to broader goals around gender, green skills, a just transition, biodiversity, health, air pollution and public engagement.

However, without strengthening the level of ambition in its NDC and providing increased levels of climate finance to support emissions reductions in less wealthy countries, the UK will be unable to improve its rating on the Climate Action Tracker.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as "Almost Sufficient". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC.

The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to "Almost Sufficient". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO2e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond.

Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action.

The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011).

The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable.

The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by:

- Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026
- Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors)
- Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026
**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Summary


## Overview

**The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential.**

**As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such,** **we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed** **from** **the new government’s climate action.** **We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025.**

**The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate.** **This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government.**

**The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country.**

A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030.

However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should:

- Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved.
- Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which:

- goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC,
- considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and
- sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms.
This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK.

However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration.

The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation pathways.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement**.** We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as "Almost Sufficient".

However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as "Insufficient".

Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased.

Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to "1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible" include:

- Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC.
- Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets.
- Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts.
We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context.

In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025.

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables.
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses.

However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

The full analysis of the UK’s policies and action is here.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being "Almost Sufficient" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway).

If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: The new UK government has yet to amend or update the UK’s existing net zero target. As such, the evaluation of the UK’s net zero target here refers to the existing targets and architecture set up by the previous government.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK and a delineation of separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases, including emissions from international aviation and shipping. The net zero target’s key strength is its periodic carbon budgets and associated intermediate targets: by means of five-year statutory carbon budgets, a clear timeline is provided that will facilitate the tracking of progress towards net zero.

Some explanation on why the target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The UK aims to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (UK Government 2021b).
- **International aviation and shipping** –The Climate Change Act itself does not yet specify whether emissions from international aviation and shipping are included in the new 2050 target. However, the sixth carbon budget will count emissions from international aviation and shipping towards the UK’s emissions (UK Government 2021d). As the 2050 target will be achieved via carbon budgets, the inclusion of aviation and shipping in the sixth carbon budget suggests that the 2050 target will also account for international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – When introducing the net zero target in 2019, the Prime Minister’s office announced that the UK “will retain the ability to use international carbon credits […] to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation” (UK Government 2019b). However, around the same time, the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy specifically stated, in an answer given to a question in parliament, that the government did not intend to use international credits to achieve its net zero target (UK Government 2019a). Given the contradicting nature of official statements relating to this indicator, an “poor” rating has been assigned to the UK. However, this would be changed to a positive rating upon an official commitment to rule out the use of international credits, which was not present in the latest description of the UK's net zero targets (DESNZ 2023a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The UK’s 2050 target was enshrined in law in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The intermediate emissions targets, in the form of carbon budgets are also legislated for and legally binding. The UK has also submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy (UK Government 2021b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy includes several scenarios with varying levels of negative emissions in 2050 (UK Government 2021b), but does not set specific emissions reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – The UK has a legally binding process in place to review progress on achieving the net zero target (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee 2021). The Secretary of State is obliged to provide an annual statement on UK emissions trends, as well as a statement on whether each successive carbon budget has been met. There is also a provision that allows for the amendment of the 2050 target if there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change or in international law or policy.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** **–** In the Net Zero Strategy, the UK government has outlined the ranges of removals expected in 2050 from both bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). The Government aims to remove 75–81 MtCO2 by 2050 by these methods, which is more than suggested by the CCC (UK Government 2021b, CCC 2020). Updated estimates of 2050 carbon dioxide removal levels were not provided in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which considers only the period out to 2037.While transparent communication is to be welcomed, the UK’s target therefore displays a considerable reliance on removals, which could pose a delivery risk, due to the uncertainty around the technical feasibility of engineered CO2 removal (Grant et al 2021a). The Net Zero strategy does consider how CO2 storage potential could constrain carbon dioxide removal via BECCS and DACCS. This could represent a short-term constraint on CO2 removal in the 2030s (UK Government 2021b). The Government is working to develop CO2 storage infrastructure, including by developing a business model to incentivise the transport and storage of CO2.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy from October 2021 provides a range of sector-specific pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 (UK Government 2021b). The Climate Change Act’s legally binding carbon budgets provide a clear timeline that will help track progress towards net zero. In this way, the UK has some of the key elements of good practice in the area of comprehensive planning to reach net zero. The updated Carbon Budget Delivery Plan sets a new standard in transparency around the government’s plans to reduce emissions in line with net zero (DESNZ 2023a). This improved transparency, while welcome, has highlighted a large number of critical policy gaps in the UK’s pathway towards net zero. With only 24–32% of the necessary emissions reductions covered by credible policy, the UK’s current approach cannot be deemed credible, unless further action is taken (CCC 2023a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The CCC’s advice includes an assessment of the implications of different equity principles. The report concludes that the UK would have to do more than the world as a whole for its target to be considered ambitious and aligned fair share principles (CCC 2020). The report goes on to explain how the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target could be addressed. However, the Climate Change Act itself does not reference fairness nor equity in the context of its net zero target, neither does the Net Zero Strategy itself.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The UK’s 2035 target in its new NDC is ambitious and would translate to emissions below our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathway (MDP). Given that the 2035 target can also be reasonably achieved from the 2030 target, we label the UK’s new NDC as “1.5°C compatible” against MDPs. We welcome this proposed emissions cut for 2035 on the road to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and it is the first developed country to get this assessment.

At the same time, some key issues should be highlighted:

- First, the UK should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The UK’s current 2030 climate target of a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is very close to the 70% cut needed to align with these pathways. In 2023, UK emissions were estimated to already be 53% below 1990 levels. Updating the 2030 target could be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets also.
- Second, the UK should consider going beyond the minimum targets set by MDPs which are a floor, not a ceiling of ambition.
- While this 2035 target aligns with cost-effective pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically. The UK should therefore increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally, and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- What matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. The new government has inherited a vast implementation gap, with existing policies covering only 24% of the emission reductions needed to meet the new 2035 target. Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this new ambition into reality.
- The UK should not be developing new oil and gas resources and needs to progress its phase out of fossil fuels beyond coal. Leadership is badly needed on this issue globally and it is very bad signal if the UK follows the US Trump Administration on this issue.
The UK submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 30 January 2025 setting a target to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 keeping the same headline ambition that it announced at COP29. This target covers all sectors and all gases. With its 2035 target of 153 MtCO2e, the UK has closed the gap between its target and our 1.5°C compatible MDP in 2035 and gone slightly below the threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UK’s 2035 target is in the right ballpark for a cost-effective path to 1.5ºC. There’s also good detail on the current policy mix being implemented to cut emissions. We have the destination, and we have the tools to get there. What we now need is a detailed roadmap, breaking down sector by sector what the UK’s targets will be to achieve these emissions reductions. An updated net zero strategy will be published in “due course”, with full detail of policy packages across all sectors. The CAT is ready and waiting to evaluate this when it emerges.

The submitted NDC of 153 MtCO2e in 2035 is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is slightly below the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, however, the UK's its 2030 target of 253 MtCO2e is still slightly above the 236 MtCO2e threshold for 1.5°C MDP excluding LULUCF.

The 2035 NDC target includes detail on the actions being taken in different sectors to reduce emissions. This includes a commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, to achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030, and to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles via the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy. These plans align with the UK’s commitments under the Global Stocktake (GST).

The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with the CAT’s own power sector benchmarks, which found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Further information on the UK’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs that are at least aligned with globally cost-effective 1.5ºC pathways, and should communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.

Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. The UK has communicated that it intends to honour the commitment made by the previous government to spend GBP 11.6bn between 2021 and 2026, with at least GBP 3bn of this going to nature. This will be challenging, due to the systemic underspending on climate finance between 2021–2024, but is a welcome confirmation.

The UK then needs to commit to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026, as its 2030 and 2035 NDCs do not align with its fair share of global mitigation, and its provision of finance is currently rated as “Highly Insufficient."


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the huge emissions gap between current policies and a 1.5°C pathway. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The UK’s NDC fits within its institutional framework for planning, delivering and monitoring emission reductions. As such, it is a broadly credible document which demonstrates how planning and monitoring can help deliver on the commitments made.

However, planning and monitoring can only get you so far. Ultimately what is needed is action, and fast. The UK government inherited a vast implementation gap from the previous administration, with only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s NDC covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024). While the Government has made steps in addressing this, much more will need to be done.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The UK has often been a leader in the transparency of its communications to the UNFCCC. While this NDC provides a large amount of detail, the UK has missed the opportunity to provide clarity in three key areas: LULUCF, carbon removal, and carbon credits. The UK’s LULUCF emissions are very small compared to total emissions (at less than 1% of total emissions in 2022), and so the lack of clarity on LULUCF is perhaps less of an issue.

However, the UK has been criticised for relying too heavily on carbon dioxide removal in its long-term strategy and net-zero targets. In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.

# Policies & action

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The new government needs to take rapid action to develop and implement climate policies to reduce emissions. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emissions reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

The UK’s stalled progress in climate policy development over recent years means that, without immediate and rapid change, the UK can no longer be considered a leader in global climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The new government has strongly indicated that it intends to address this policy shortfall, introducing new funding and delivery mechanisms to close the gap. The CAT will be tracking these policy developments and provide an updated assessment of the progress made in 2025.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.


## Policy overview

The new government has inherited a challenging policy context. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays to key delivery mechanisms, rollbacks to other essential climate polices, and a clear lack of commitment to reducing emissions at the pace and scale needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. As a result, in July 2024, only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to reach the UK’s climate targets were covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024).

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind (DESNZ, 2024c) and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables (DESNZ, 2024a, 2024d).
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements (Seddon, 2024), has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (DESNZ, 2024b) (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest renewable auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is still not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise industrial electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentive industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. These policy rollbacks should be reversed.

## Power sector

The UK’s power sector crossed a milestone in October 2024 when the last coal-fired power station shut down. Rapid growth in renewables has phased out coal without increasing demand for fossil gas generation. In 2023, almost half of the UK’s electricity came from renewables, with a third of generation from wind and solar alone.

The focus must now turn to phasing out fossil gas. The UK has a target of achieving clean power by 2030 – this is a laudable goal which would put the UK at the forefront of the global power sector transition and demonstrate the viability of a fully decarbonised power sector to all.

**Coal**

The UK’s last coal-fired power station closed in October 2024, marking the end of an era. This historic moment puts the UK as a front-runner in the transition away from coal in the power sector, phasing out coal six years ahead of the 2030 deadline for developed countries (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

The UK’s coal exit is one of its main climate policy success stories of the past decade. As recently as 2012, coal provided 40% of the UK electricity mix (Ember, 2023). The rapid phase-out of coal means that power sector emissions fell on average by 10% each year between 2012–2022 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023).

**Fossil gas and oil**

The new UK government has a target to achieve “clean power” by 2030. While it has not provided the exact definition of clean power, this ultimately must involve phasing out fossil gas in the power sector. The CAT has found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with these benchmarks. Detailed modelling has shown that it is possible to push fossil gas out of the electricity system (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

It is unlikely that the UK will be able to fully phase out fossil gas in the electricity mix by 2030. However, it is possible to substantially cut gas demand. Detailed modelling highlights that the share of gas in the electricity system could fall to below 2% by 2030 without compromising security of supply (Ember, 2022). Keeping some of the fossil gas fleet as a “cold reserve” to provide very limited generation in periods of low renewable supply could help maintain energy security in the UK, while having a minimal impact on emissions. This fossil gas could then be fully phased out as alternative options to provide this back-up generation are deployed.

There is a wide range of options that can help balance a clean grid, including batteries, hydrogen, pumped storage, interconnectors and demand-side management. As such, fossil gas with CCS should play, at most, a minimal role in the power sector. Detailed modelling suggests that the UK could meet future electricity demand reliably in a grid dominated by wind and solar, with as little as 2.6 GW of fossil gas with CCS in the power sector in 2030, and only 0–5 GW by 2035 (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

Current CCS projects under development would be sufficient to reach this level. The UK should avoid embarking on a path of heavy reliance on fossil gas with CCS in the power sector, focussing instead on other measures to provide reliable zero-carbon electricity. Deploying turbines which can run on green hydrogen would be a key way to provide long-term flexible electricity generation without relying on CCS.

**Renewables**

The UK government is aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to support its goal of clean power by 2030 (Parkinson, 2024). Turbocharging renewables will be crucial to aligning with 1.5ºC, with the CAT finding that in the UK, the share of renewables in the power sector should reach 84–93% by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s goal of clean power by 2030 would align with this, depending on the exact assumptions made about the role of nuclear power in the electricity system.

Getting sufficient renewables capacity connected to the grid and generating before 2030 will be a herculean challenge. The UK has a range of policies to support renewables deployment. The central policy is the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme, which offers a guaranteed price to renewable generators over their lifetime, with the price set by reverse auctions. This has encouraged competition and innovation in the sector and driven large-scale investment and deployment. Wind capacity more than doubled in the past decade to 30 GW in 2023, while solar capacity grew from 3 GW in 2013 to 16 GW in 2022 (Ember, 2023).

However, as of July 2024, there were around 30 GW of offshore wind either in operation or in active development of some form (Ember, 2024). Given the lead time for offshore wind projects, this would mean that the 2024/2025 auctions would need to achieve over 20 GW of offshore wind deployment to keep the power sector on track for the 2030 goals (Ember, 2024). The 2024 auction achieved only 5 GW, putting offshore wind deployment in the UK significantly off track for the governments’ aims, and making the 2025 auction a critical policy milestone. Onshore wind and solar PV installation rates are also off track. The new government will need to move fast to try and address these issues and get renewables deployed at the pace and scale needed for its 100% clean power goal.


## Industry

The UK’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy introduced by the previous government (UK Government, 2021a) aims to reduce industrial emissions by two-thirds below 2018 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050. While emissions fell 3% in 2022 to 63 MtCO2e, they will need to fall much faster, by around 8% per year, to achieve the government’s climate targets (CCC, 2023a).

The strategy has a three-pronged approach: switching to low carbon fuels, efficiency gains, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). While some action is beginning to occur on fuel-switching, in particular in the electrification of steel, there remain significant gaps in the policies supporting resource efficiency in the industrial sector (CCC, 2024).

**Fuel switching**

In 2023, over 50% of industrial final energy was provided directly by fossil fuels (DESNZ, 2024c). This will need to be reduced substantially on the path to net zero. Two key options are the use of hydrogen, and direct electrification.

The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy sets a target of 50 TWh of fossil fuels to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives by 2035 in the manufacturing sector (UK Government, 2021a). This is roughly a third of industrial fossil consumption in 2022. To support this target, the previous government introduced the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme.

This is similar to the CfD scheme in the power sector, providing financial support to cover the additional cost of low-carbon hydrogen production. GBP 140m was allocated to support fuel-switching over 2023–2024. This provides a business model to support industrial fuel-switching to hydrogen and is a positive step. There is also a GBP 240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (DESNZ, 2023). While these funds are to be welcomed, they are much smaller than the scale of funds being offered in Europe to support hydrogen deployment (Abnett, 2023).

Industrial electrification has taken a step forwards in the UK, with the agreement of a deal to transform the Tata steelworks from a coal-fired blast furnace to an electric arc furnace producing recycled steel (H. Thomas & Browne, 2024). In November 2023, a similar decision was announced for the remaining blast furnaces operated by British Steel, although the planned switch date of 2025 may be set back due to grid connection delays (Gill, 2024). This marks a transition away from coal in steelmaking which will reduce emissions.

However, there has not yet been sufficient planning on how to ensure a just transition which preserves jobs in local communities dependent on steelmaking. This is a critical gap that must be addressed. There is also a need to drive industrial electrification in a more systematic way, with electricity prices still too high when compared to fossil gas (CCC, 2024).

**Carbon capture and storage**

The previous government set an aim of delivering 6 MtCO2/yr of industrial CCS by 2030, and 9 MtCO2/yr by 2035. This represents around 17% of total abatement in the industrial sector by 2035 (CCC, 2023a). The new government has continued this commitment to CCS, pledging GBP 22 bn of funding to drive CCS projects over the next 25 years (UK Government, 2024). Relying too heavily on CCS to deliver emissions reductions in the industrial sector could be risky, as the majority of previous CCS projects have ended in failure (Abdulla et al., 2020). In many sectors, the role and value of CCS is also being eroded as the cost of renewables declines (Grant, Hawkes, Napp, et al., 2021). CCS should be prioritised for applications where there are few alternatives, such as cement production (E3G, 2023).

**Fossil fuel supply**

Achieving the UK’s climate targets will require strong and sustained reductions in oil and gas production, as well as improvements to the emissions intensity of any remaining extraction. Oil and gas demand will need to fall around 30% by 2030 to achieve the UK’s NDC (CCC, 2020). The CCC also suggested that the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction should fall 68% by 2030, through electrification of processes and addressing fugitive emissions (CCC, 2020).

The previous UK government moved in the opposite direction, continuing to support new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, approving the Abigail, Jackdaw and Talbot fields (Oil and Gas Authority, 2023; A. Thomas, 2022; Tidman, 2022). New licensing rounds were held annually (UK Government, 2023a).

The incoming government has set a new direction, committing to end licensing for new oil and gas fields (Lempriere, 2024). This is a good start and should be welcomed. However, it does not address the substantial pipeline of projects which have already received exploration licenses and are either waiting for development consent or are already in production. There are thirteen such projects awaiting approval (Dunne, 2024).

The new government could strengthen its position on oil and gas by publicly committing to not approve this remaining pipeline of projects, and also set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals, for example joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).


## Transport

The transport sector is the largest source of emissions in the UK, representing 29% of emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Central to decarbonising transport is ending the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans by 2030 and fossil fuelled heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2035–40 (Department for Transport, 2021).

The policy context that the new UK government has inherited is mixed. On the one hand, the previous government confirmed the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2023, which sets minimum EV sales targets for each vehicle manufacturer and will be a key delivery mechanism in scaling up EV sales (UK Government, 2023b). At the same time, the government pushed back the date of the sales ban on internal combustion engine cars from 2030 to 2035, sending a very mixed signal to the public and automotive industry. In 2023, the share of electric car sales in the UK failed to grow, flatlining at 16.5% and falling off track for the UK’s transition for the first time (SMMT, 2024). The share of electric van sales is growing much more slowly and is significantly off-track (CCC, 2024).

Key actions for the new government should include:

- **Reinstating the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales**
- **Taking action to help accelerate EV rollout**. This should include removing barriers for the installation of EV chargers and working with major van fleet operators to understand barriers to EV uptake.
**Aviation**

In 2022, the UK released its Jet Zero Strategy which aims to reduce emissions from this sector to net zero (Department for Transport, 2022). This aims for domestic aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and total aviation emissions to reach net zero by 2050.

However, in this context, net zero does not mean eliminating the negative climate impacts of aviation, but rather allowing for a large-scale growth in emissions that would be compensated for via the UK emissions trading scheme, CORSIA and other offsetting mechanisms outside the aviation sector. The strategy also ignores the non-CO2 impact of aviation, which represents up to two-thirds of the sector’s overall climate impact (Lee et al., 2021).

The UK’s current strategy relies heavily on speculative technological innovation and carbon dioxide removal to enable a ‘net zero’ aviation sector, without addressing the elephant in the room – demand.

The previous government committed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would provide 10% of overall fuel use by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040 (UK Department for Transport, 2024). This is five times the level included in the CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway and would require an unprecedented scale-up of SAF production. The new government confirmed this commitment, and introduced a SAF mandate to drive this uptake (Department for Transport, 2024). There will also be a revenue certainty mechanism to provide confidence to investors seeking to build SAF plants to meet UK demand. However, SAF deployment remains very low globally and has consistently failed to meet expectations (Rutherford, 2022). Relying so heavily on this option therefore represents a major delivery risk.

The Jet Zero strategy also fails to address demand. The Government states that “the sector can achieve Jet Zero without the government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth” (Department for Transport, 2022), and envisages that passenger numbers could rise 70% from 2021 to 2050. This is in contrast to the CCC’s advice, which was that no net expansion in airport capacity should be permitted, and passenger growth should be 25% at most (CCC, 2020). Numerous airports are currently planning expansions or have received approval to expand in the past two years (AEF, 2022) which again could threaten the UK’s ability to achieve its climate targets. As yet, the new government has not provided any clear commitments that it will curb aviation demand, with the chancellor repeatedly mentioning aviation as a key engine of economic growth (Topham, 2024).

As a result, in 2050, the Jet Zero strategy expects that aviation will still be emitting around 19 MtCO2 per year, which will need to be compensated for by CO2 removal. Given the very limited potential for CO2 removal and uncertainties in the climate system, CO2 removal should be reserved to hedge against climate uncertainties and balance out truly hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g. from agriculture), rather than to facilitate a stark increase in aviation emissions in one of the world’s wealthiest countries.

For more information on the need to align aviation and shipping emissions with the Paris Agreement, see the sectoral pages oninternational aviation and international shipping.


## Buildings

Buildings were responsible for 20% of UK emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Emissions fell strongly in 2023 by 7.2% relative to 2022, due to reductions in gas demand (CCC, 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this was due to gas prices (which remain above the levels seen before the fossil gas energy crisis) or due to other drivers. Importantly, key indicators for tracking buildings decarbonisation, including the rate of heat pump installations and the rate of energy efficiency installations, are lagging far behind the level needed.

The number of heat pumps installed in 2023 increased only 4% from 2022 (CCC, 2024). The growth rate should be nearer 40–50% per year, if the number of annual installations is to reach 600,000–900,000 by 2030. Meanwhile the number of energy efficiency installations driven by government schemes fell in 2023, moving significantly off-track. This suggests that, without government action, the emissions reductions seen in 2023 will not be sustained into the future.

Priority actions for the new government should include:

- **Introducing a comprehensive programme for decarbonising public sector buildings**. Public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings represent a low-hanging fruit which could deliver substantial emissions reductions quickly.
- **Removing planning barriers to heat pumps**. The previous Government proposed such changes which would make it easier to install heat pumps (DLUHC, 2024). The new government should implement these changes immediately.
- **Re-introducing obligations for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented homes.** The new government has committed to do this in its manifesto – it must now turn this ambition into action.
- **Removing the exemption of 20% of houses from the fossil-fuel boiler installation phase-out**. The previous government introduced this exemption, suggesting that it would save money. However, maintaining the gas distribution network for such a small set of households would likely increase, not reduce costs.

## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for 12% of UK emissions in 2022 (DESNZ, 2024a). There has been essentially no progress made in agricultural decarbonisation over the past decade, with emissions in 2022 at the same level as in 2012.

In many places, the existing policy portfolio for agricultural decarbonisation is “too little, too late”. There is still no ban on the use of peat in gardening products, and plans to introduce methane-supressing feed products by 2030 are too late.

Key actions for the new government include:

- **Introducing policies to hedge against the risk of delivery failure**. The existing approach to agricultural decarbonisation has relied heavily on measures which are technological and voluntary in nature: this is a significant delivery risk. Productivity improvements on their own will not necessarily reduce emissions, with a risk that farmers simply increase herd numbers instead of freeing up land. Policies need to be developed to address these risks.
- **Introducing measures to** **address dietary change and food waste prevention**. The existing Government Food Strategy does not introduce measures to support and accelerate dietary shifts, despite the clear health benefits of doing so, and the evidence of consumer appetite for reduced meat consumption (Stewart et al., 2021; UK Government, 2022). The Food Strategy also only addressed food waste from large businesses, despite the majority of food waste occurring at the household, farm and supply-chain stages.
The UK has one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe, at 13% (Forest Research, 2023). The UK has set a target of planting 30,000 ha/yr of new woodland by 2025, which is aligned with the CCC’s recommendations. However, planting rates in 2023 were under half of this level (Forest Research, 2023).

It is essential that the new government takes action to accelerate tree planting. This will require new delivery mechanisms, complete with the required rates of funding. In particular, there is a need to provide clear long-term funding, and to streamline processes in order to draw in private capital.

Progress in protecting and restoring degraded peatland is also significantly off track. The Climate Change Committee recommends that over 60,000 ha/yr of peatland is restored from 2025 onwards. But in 2022/23, only 13,000 ha were restored – less than a fifth of recommended levels (CCC, 2023a). Key policy gaps include restrictions on the burning of peatland, as much peatland remains unprotected by current legislation, and a faster phase-out for peat in horticultural products, as the sale of peat will currently only be fully banned by 2030 (The Wildlife Trusts, 2023).


## Methane

14% of the UK’s total emissions in 2022 came from methane (DESNZ, 2024a), with 80% of these emissions coming from agriculture and waste. The UK is also a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, which sets a target of reducing methane emissions by 30% over 2020–2030. However, to date methane emission reductions are not happening fast enough in the UK. On average, methane emissions fell 0.9 MtCO2e/yr over 2015–2022. This would need to double to over 1.9 Mt CO2e/yr to reach the current 2030 targets.

Key actions for the government to take include:

- **Publishing plans to capture methane emissions** from landfill sites, as well as improving the monitoring of landfill emissions.
- **Develop plans to reduce methane emissions from agriculture**. This should include accelerating the deployment of methane-supressing feed products within the industry, as well as promoting measures to cut demand for meat and dairy.
- **Track, monitor and transparently report** on the UK’s progress towards the Global Methane Pledge.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data for 1990–2021 were obtained from the UK Government (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023a). Provisional emissions data for 2022 was also included to extend the time series to 2021 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023b). The UK provides inventory data to the UNFCCC that includes emissions from Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which are not covered by UK climate policy and are not included in government emission projections. For this reason, we have chosen to use national emissions statistics rather than UNFCCC inventory emissions.


## NDC and other targets

The UK’s 2030 NDC target of at least a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is expressed using 100 year global warming potentials (GWP100) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Government of the UK, 2022). In addition, the UK Government has specified that the target reference year includes F-gas emissions from 1995. Thus, to quantify the expected 2030 emissions, we apply the 68% reduction to a reference emissions level consisting of the UK’s emissions in 1990 but including F-gas from 1995 instead of 1990, all expressed in AR5 GWPs.

As the CAT presents all data across countries in GWP from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the 2030 emissions implied by the NDC target in AR5 GWPs are then converted back into AR4 GWP. This is done by calculating a historical conversion factor from AR5 GWPs to AR4 GWPs, using historical data from 2021. This conversion factor can then be used to calculate the NDC in 2030 in AR4 GWPs.

The UK’s 2030 (NDC) and 2035 (Sixth Carbon Budget) emissions targets includes LULUCF emissions. This needs to be subtracted for comparability with other countries. We use projections from the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget to estimate LULUCF emissions in 2030 and 2035 (CCC, 2020). While the government’s approach to achieving the NDC and Sixth Carbon Budget differs somewhat from the CCC, there is strong alignment on afforestation pledges, and so LULUCF emissions will likely be closely aligned with the CCC’s projections, if these targets are to be met.

The UK’s 2035 emissions target additionally includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. These emissions were added to the 1990 baseline when calculating what a 78% reduction would entail. Projected 2035 emissions from international aviation and shipping were then removed from the implied 2035 target, as these emissions are captured under our IMO and ICAO assessments and would be double counted if they remained as part of the UK’s total emissions. Data is taken from the UK’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (DESNZ, 2023a).

The UK’s 2050 net-zero target also includes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, which need to be removed. In the absence of long-term projections from the UK Government, we use the Sixth Carbon Budget to calculate LULUCF and international shipping emissions in 2050, while the high ambition scenario from the recent Jet Zero strategy is used to estimate aviation emissions in 2050 (CCC, 2020; Department for Transport, 2022).


## Current policy projections

NOTE: Current policy projections for the UK have not been updated since the September 2023 CAT profile. A new current policy projection will be quantified in 2025.

To estimate current policy projections, we use the 2023 progress report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC, 2023a). In this report, the CCC estimates the impact of current UK policies on emissions. Policies are ranked as ‘credible’, displaying ‘some risks’ to delivery, displaying ‘significant risks’ to delivery, or ‘insufficient’.

To calculate the upper range of the current policies trajectory, we take the impact of all credible policies. These are policies where there are proven delivery mechanisms, a credible combination of public/private financing and clear timelines in place. The resulting emissions savings come predominantly from the zero-emissions vehicle mandate to drive EV sales and the renewable electricity supply policies in the power sector. To estimate the lower end of the current policy trajectory, we additionally include the impact of all policies ranked as displaying ‘some risks’. These include policies around home decarbonisation, industrial CCS, hydrogen, and also some policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors.

The CCC estimates that in 2030, there are credible policies to cut emissions by 42 MtCO2e, relative to the baseline. Policies with some risks to delivery could cut emissions by a further 51 MtCO2e in 2030. This gives an emissions level in 2030 (converting to AR4 GWPs and removing international aviation and shipping and LULUCF emissions, all of which are included in the CCC’s estimates) of 340–394 MtCO2e.

The conversion from AR5 to AR4 GWPs is done in the same way as when calculating the UK’s emissions targets, by calculating the ratio between AR5 and AR4 GWPs for 2021. Future LULUCF and international bunker emissions are taken from the UK’s Net Zero Strategy (UK Government, 2021b).

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UK has set a target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target includes international aviation and shipping (IAS) emissions, as well as LULUCF emissions and removals from BECCS/DACCS (UK Government, 2019d). The CAT assesses IAS and LULUCF separately, and therefore these need to be removed from the projections.

The UK Government does not provide detail on the LULUCF emissions they assume in 2050. In the absence of this, we take analysis from the CCC, which suggested that in the Balanced Net Zero pathway which reaches net zero by 2050, LULUCF emissions would be -19 MtCO2/yr (CCC, 2020). We also use this source to estimate future emissions from IAS. In the Balanced Net Zero pathway, emissions from aviation and shipping in 2050 are 24 MtCO2. Assuming an equal split between international and domestic aviation/shipping in 2050 as in 2019, this means that in 2050, IAS emissions would be 19 MtCO2/yr.

Under these assumptions, the UK’s net zero target remains a 0 MtCO2e target in 2050 once LULUCF and IAS have been removed. However, in reality, the UK Government intends residual emissions to fall to around 70-80 MtCO2e/yr, with engineered removals from BECCS/DACCS offsetting these remaining emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In 2020, the UK updated its 2030 NDC to reduce GHG emissions by at least 68% below 1990 levels (including LULUCF and excluding international aviation and shipping). This is an increase on the previous target of a 57% reduction below 1990 levels. The UK also set a 2035 target to reduce emissions by 78% below 1990 levels including both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping. The CAT excludes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping from its analysis. Converting to this basis, the UK’s targets are to reduce emissions by 68% and 82% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 2035 respectively.

In 2019, the UK increased the ambition of its 2050 target to net zero GHG emissions (UK Government, 2019d).

*The CAT focuses on future emissions excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping (international bunker) emissions. The UK’s net zero target covers both LULUCF and international bunkers. The CCC’s path for reaching net zero by 2050 involves residual emissions of ~19 MtCO2e from international bunkers, and also a 19 MtCO2e sink from the LULUCF sector. These offset one another so that 2050 emissions remain at 0 MtCO2e. However, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions, with residual emissions from aviation and other sectors balanced by removals from LULUCF and engineered CO2 removal.


## NDC updates

**2030 NDC targets**

On 12 December 2020, the UK submitted its first updated NDC to the UNFCCC after leaving the European Union. This NDC commits the UK to reducing GHG emissions to 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. This represents a significant strengthening from the UK’s previous 2030 commitment, which was to reduce emissions by 57% below 1990 levels. The UK’s NDC is now aligned with its 2050 target of achieving net zero GHG emissions, according to analysis by the CCC (CCC, 2020).

The UK’s NDC is not fully aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways. This represents a downgrade from previous CAT analyses (from 2022 and earlier), due to the use of more recent global pathways aligned with 1.5ºC. A further strengthening of the UK’s NDC is therefore necessary to align with the latest evidence coming from least-cost modelled 1.5°C compatible domestic pathways. Strengthening the UK’s NDC would also better enable the UK to embody the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities that are central to the Paris Agreement.

Analysis has shown that an emissions reductions target of up to 70% (CCC, 2020) and towards 75% would be achievable (WWF, 2020). However, each day of delay makes achieving deep emission reductions much more challenging.

The UK revisited and updated its NDC on 23 September 2022 (Government of the UK, 2022). The UK did not strengthen the overall GHG emissions reductions target, as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 under the UK’s presidency. It did, however, provide a range of additional information to increase clarity, transparency and understanding.

This includes information on how the UK will deliver its NDC by 2030, how it will assess the NDC’s achievement, an update on the NDC’s territorial scope (which includes the Crown Territory of Jersey and Overseas Dependency of Gibraltar), and more information on how the UK’s climate targets relate to broader goals around gender, green skills, a just transition, biodiversity, health, air pollution and public engagement.

However, without strengthening the level of ambition in its NDC and providing increased levels of climate finance to support emissions reductions in less wealthy countries, the UK will be unable to improve its rating on the Climate Action Tracker.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis****:**

## CAT rating of targets

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as "Almost Sufficient". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC.

The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to "Almost Sufficient". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO2e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond.

Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action.

The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011).

The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable.

The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by:

- Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026
- Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors)
- Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026
**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Summary


## Overview

**The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential.**

**As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such,** **we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed** **from** **the new government’s climate action.** **We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025.**

**The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate.** **This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government.**

**The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country.**

A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030.

However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should:

- Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved.
- Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which:

- goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC,
- considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and
- sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms.
This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK.

However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration.

The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation pathways.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement**.** We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as "Almost Sufficient".

However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as "Insufficient".

Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased.

Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to "1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible" include:

- Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC.
- Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets.
- Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts.
We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context.

In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025.

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables.
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses.

However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

The full analysis of the UK’s policies and action is here.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being "Almost Sufficient" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway).

If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

**For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: The new UK government has yet to amend or update the UK’s existing net zero target. As such, the evaluation of the UK’s net zero target here refers to the existing targets and architecture set up by the previous government.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK and a delineation of separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases, including emissions from international aviation and shipping. The net zero target’s key strength is its periodic carbon budgets and associated intermediate targets: by means of five-year statutory carbon budgets, a clear timeline is provided that will facilitate the tracking of progress towards net zero.

Some explanation on why the target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The UK aims to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (UK Government 2021b).
- **International aviation and shipping** –The Climate Change Act itself does not yet specify whether emissions from international aviation and shipping are included in the new 2050 target. However, the sixth carbon budget will count emissions from international aviation and shipping towards the UK’s emissions (UK Government 2021d). As the 2050 target will be achieved via carbon budgets, the inclusion of aviation and shipping in the sixth carbon budget suggests that the 2050 target will also account for international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – When introducing the net zero target in 2019, the Prime Minister’s office announced that the UK “will retain the ability to use international carbon credits […] to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation” (UK Government 2019b). However, around the same time, the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy specifically stated, in an answer given to a question in parliament, that the government did not intend to use international credits to achieve its net zero target (UK Government 2019a). Given the contradicting nature of official statements relating to this indicator, an “poor” rating has been assigned to the UK. However, this would be changed to a positive rating upon an official commitment to rule out the use of international credits, which was not present in the latest description of the UK's net zero targets (DESNZ 2023a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The UK’s 2050 target was enshrined in law in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The intermediate emissions targets, in the form of carbon budgets are also legislated for and legally binding. The UK has also submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy (UK Government 2021b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy includes several scenarios with varying levels of negative emissions in 2050 (UK Government 2021b), but does not set specific emissions reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – The UK has a legally binding process in place to review progress on achieving the net zero target (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee 2021). The Secretary of State is obliged to provide an annual statement on UK emissions trends, as well as a statement on whether each successive carbon budget has been met. There is also a provision that allows for the amendment of the 2050 target if there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change or in international law or policy.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** **–** In the Net Zero Strategy, the UK government has outlined the ranges of removals expected in 2050 from both bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). The Government aims to remove 75–81 MtCO2 by 2050 by these methods, which is more than suggested by the CCC (UK Government 2021b, CCC 2020). Updated estimates of 2050 carbon dioxide removal levels were not provided in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which considers only the period out to 2037.While transparent communication is to be welcomed, the UK’s target therefore displays a considerable reliance on removals, which could pose a delivery risk, due to the uncertainty around the technical feasibility of engineered CO2 removal (Grant et al 2021a). The Net Zero strategy does consider how CO2 storage potential could constrain carbon dioxide removal via BECCS and DACCS. This could represent a short-term constraint on CO2 removal in the 2030s (UK Government 2021b). The Government is working to develop CO2 storage infrastructure, including by developing a business model to incentivise the transport and storage of CO2.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy from October 2021 provides a range of sector-specific pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 (UK Government 2021b). The Climate Change Act’s legally binding carbon budgets provide a clear timeline that will help track progress towards net zero. In this way, the UK has some of the key elements of good practice in the area of comprehensive planning to reach net zero. The updated Carbon Budget Delivery Plan sets a new standard in transparency around the government’s plans to reduce emissions in line with net zero (DESNZ 2023a). This improved transparency, while welcome, has highlighted a large number of critical policy gaps in the UK’s pathway towards net zero. With only 24–32% of the necessary emissions reductions covered by credible policy, the UK’s current approach cannot be deemed credible, unless further action is taken (CCC 2023a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The CCC’s advice includes an assessment of the implications of different equity principles. The report concludes that the UK would have to do more than the world as a whole for its target to be considered ambitious and aligned fair share principles (CCC 2020). The report goes on to explain how the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target could be addressed. However, the Climate Change Act itself does not reference fairness nor equity in the context of its net zero target, neither does the Net Zero Strategy itself.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The UK’s 2035 target in its new NDC is ambitious and would translate to emissions below our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathway (MDP). Given that the 2035 target can also be reasonably achieved from the 2030 target, we label the UK’s new NDC as “1.5°C compatible” against MDPs. We welcome this proposed emissions cut for 2035 on the road to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and it is the first developed country to get this assessment.

At the same time, some key issues should be highlighted:

- First, the UK should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The UK’s current 2030 climate target of a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is very close to the 70% cut needed to align with these pathways. In 2023, UK emissions were estimated to already be 53% below 1990 levels. Updating the 2030 target could be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets also.
- Second, the UK should consider going beyond the minimum targets set by MDPs which are a floor, not a ceiling of ambition.
- While this 2035 target aligns with cost-effective pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically. The UK should therefore increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally, and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- What matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. The new government has inherited a vast implementation gap, with existing policies covering only 24% of the emission reductions needed to meet the new 2035 target. Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this new ambition into reality.
- The UK should not be developing new oil and gas resources and needs to progress its phase out of fossil fuels beyond coal. Leadership is badly needed on this issue globally and it is very bad signal if the UK follows the US Trump Administration on this issue.
The UK submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 30 January 2025 setting a target to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 keeping the same headline ambition that it announced at COP29. This target covers all sectors and all gases. With its 2035 target of 153 MtCO2e, the UK has closed the gap between its target and our 1.5°C compatible MDP in 2035 and gone slightly below the threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UK’s 2035 target is in the right ballpark for a cost-effective path to 1.5ºC. There’s also good detail on the current policy mix being implemented to cut emissions. We have the destination, and we have the tools to get there. What we now need is a detailed roadmap, breaking down sector by sector what the UK’s targets will be to achieve these emissions reductions. An updated net zero strategy will be published in “due course”, with full detail of policy packages across all sectors. The CAT is ready and waiting to evaluate this when it emerges.

The submitted NDC of 153 MtCO2e in 2035 is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is slightly below the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, however, the UK's its 2030 target of 253 MtCO2e is still slightly above the 236 MtCO2e threshold for 1.5°C MDP excluding LULUCF.

The 2035 NDC target includes detail on the actions being taken in different sectors to reduce emissions. This includes a commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, to achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030, and to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles via the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy. These plans align with the UK’s commitments under the Global Stocktake (GST).

The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with the CAT’s own power sector benchmarks, which found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Further information on the UK’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs that are at least aligned with globally cost-effective 1.5ºC pathways, and should communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.

Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. The UK has communicated that it intends to honour the commitment made by the previous government to spend GBP 11.6bn between 2021 and 2026, with at least GBP 3bn of this going to nature. This will be challenging, due to the systemic underspending on climate finance between 2021–2024, but is a welcome confirmation.

The UK then needs to commit to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026, as its 2030 and 2035 NDCs do not align with its fair share of global mitigation, and its provision of finance is currently rated as “Highly Insufficient."


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the huge emissions gap between current policies and a 1.5°C pathway. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The UK’s NDC fits within its institutional framework for planning, delivering and monitoring emission reductions. As such, it is a broadly credible document which demonstrates how planning and monitoring can help deliver on the commitments made.

However, planning and monitoring can only get you so far. Ultimately what is needed is action, and fast. The UK government inherited a vast implementation gap from the previous administration, with only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s NDC covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024). While the Government has made steps in addressing this, much more will need to be done.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The UK has often been a leader in the transparency of its communications to the UNFCCC. While this NDC provides a large amount of detail, the UK has missed the opportunity to provide clarity in three key areas: LULUCF, carbon removal, and carbon credits. The UK’s LULUCF emissions are very small compared to total emissions (at less than 1% of total emissions in 2022), and so the lack of clarity on LULUCF is perhaps less of an issue.

However, the UK has been criticised for relying too heavily on carbon dioxide removal in its long-term strategy and net-zero targets. In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.

# Policies & action

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The new government needs to take rapid action to develop and implement climate policies to reduce emissions. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emissions reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

The UK’s stalled progress in climate policy development over recent years means that, without immediate and rapid change, the UK can no longer be considered a leader in global climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The new government has strongly indicated that it intends to address this policy shortfall, introducing new funding and delivery mechanisms to close the gap. The CAT will be tracking these policy developments and provide an updated assessment of the progress made in 2025.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.


## Policy overview

The new government has inherited a challenging policy context. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays to key delivery mechanisms, rollbacks to other essential climate polices, and a clear lack of commitment to reducing emissions at the pace and scale needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. As a result, in July 2024, only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to reach the UK’s climate targets were covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024).

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind (DESNZ, 2024c) and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables (DESNZ, 2024a, 2024d).
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements (Seddon, 2024), has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (DESNZ, 2024b) (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest renewable auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is still not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise industrial electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentive industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. These policy rollbacks should be reversed.

## Power sector

The UK’s power sector crossed a milestone in October 2024 when the last coal-fired power station shut down. Rapid growth in renewables has phased out coal without increasing demand for fossil gas generation. In 2023, almost half of the UK’s electricity came from renewables, with a third of generation from wind and solar alone.

The focus must now turn to phasing out fossil gas. The UK has a target of achieving clean power by 2030 – this is a laudable goal which would put the UK at the forefront of the global power sector transition and demonstrate the viability of a fully decarbonised power sector to all.

**Coal**

The UK’s last coal-fired power station closed in October 2024, marking the end of an era. This historic moment puts the UK as a front-runner in the transition away from coal in the power sector, phasing out coal six years ahead of the 2030 deadline for developed countries (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

The UK’s coal exit is one of its main climate policy success stories of the past decade. As recently as 2012, coal provided 40% of the UK electricity mix (Ember, 2023). The rapid phase-out of coal means that power sector emissions fell on average by 10% each year between 2012–2022 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023).

**Fossil gas and oil**

The new UK government has a target to achieve “clean power” by 2030. While it has not provided the exact definition of clean power, this ultimately must involve phasing out fossil gas in the power sector. The CAT has found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with these benchmarks. Detailed modelling has shown that it is possible to push fossil gas out of the electricity system (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

It is unlikely that the UK will be able to fully phase out fossil gas in the electricity mix by 2030. However, it is possible to substantially cut gas demand. Detailed modelling highlights that the share of gas in the electricity system could fall to below 2% by 2030 without compromising security of supply (Ember, 2022). Keeping some of the fossil gas fleet as a “cold reserve” to provide very limited generation in periods of low renewable supply could help maintain energy security in the UK, while having a minimal impact on emissions. This fossil gas could then be fully phased out as alternative options to provide this back-up generation are deployed.

There is a wide range of options that can help balance a clean grid, including batteries, hydrogen, pumped storage, interconnectors and demand-side management. As such, fossil gas with CCS should play, at most, a minimal role in the power sector. Detailed modelling suggests that the UK could meet future electricity demand reliably in a grid dominated by wind and solar, with as little as 2.6 GW of fossil gas with CCS in the power sector in 2030, and only 0–5 GW by 2035 (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

Current CCS projects under development would be sufficient to reach this level. The UK should avoid embarking on a path of heavy reliance on fossil gas with CCS in the power sector, focussing instead on other measures to provide reliable zero-carbon electricity. Deploying turbines which can run on green hydrogen would be a key way to provide long-term flexible electricity generation without relying on CCS.

**Renewables**

The UK government is aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to support its goal of clean power by 2030 (Parkinson, 2024). Turbocharging renewables will be crucial to aligning with 1.5ºC, with the CAT finding that in the UK, the share of renewables in the power sector should reach 84–93% by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s goal of clean power by 2030 would align with this, depending on the exact assumptions made about the role of nuclear power in the electricity system.

Getting sufficient renewables capacity connected to the grid and generating before 2030 will be a herculean challenge. The UK has a range of policies to support renewables deployment. The central policy is the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme, which offers a guaranteed price to renewable generators over their lifetime, with the price set by reverse auctions. This has encouraged competition and innovation in the sector and driven large-scale investment and deployment. Wind capacity more than doubled in the past decade to 30 GW in 2023, while solar capacity grew from 3 GW in 2013 to 16 GW in 2022 (Ember, 2023).

However, as of July 2024, there were around 30 GW of offshore wind either in operation or in active development of some form (Ember, 2024). Given the lead time for offshore wind projects, this would mean that the 2024/2025 auctions would need to achieve over 20 GW of offshore wind deployment to keep the power sector on track for the 2030 goals (Ember, 2024). The 2024 auction achieved only 5 GW, putting offshore wind deployment in the UK significantly off track for the governments’ aims, and making the 2025 auction a critical policy milestone. Onshore wind and solar PV installation rates are also off track. The new government will need to move fast to try and address these issues and get renewables deployed at the pace and scale needed for its 100% clean power goal.


## Industry

The UK’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy introduced by the previous government (UK Government, 2021a) aims to reduce industrial emissions by two-thirds below 2018 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050. While emissions fell 3% in 2022 to 63 MtCO2e, they will need to fall much faster, by around 8% per year, to achieve the government’s climate targets (CCC, 2023a).

The strategy has a three-pronged approach: switching to low carbon fuels, efficiency gains, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). While some action is beginning to occur on fuel-switching, in particular in the electrification of steel, there remain significant gaps in the policies supporting resource efficiency in the industrial sector (CCC, 2024).

**Fuel switching**

In 2023, over 50% of industrial final energy was provided directly by fossil fuels (DESNZ, 2024c). This will need to be reduced substantially on the path to net zero. Two key options are the use of hydrogen, and direct electrification.

The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy sets a target of 50 TWh of fossil fuels to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives by 2035 in the manufacturing sector (UK Government, 2021a). This is roughly a third of industrial fossil consumption in 2022. To support this target, the previous government introduced the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme.

This is similar to the CfD scheme in the power sector, providing financial support to cover the additional cost of low-carbon hydrogen production. GBP 140m was allocated to support fuel-switching over 2023–2024. This provides a business model to support industrial fuel-switching to hydrogen and is a positive step. There is also a GBP 240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (DESNZ, 2023). While these funds are to be welcomed, they are much smaller than the scale of funds being offered in Europe to support hydrogen deployment (Abnett, 2023).

Industrial electrification has taken a step forwards in the UK, with the agreement of a deal to transform the Tata steelworks from a coal-fired blast furnace to an electric arc furnace producing recycled steel (H. Thomas & Browne, 2024). In November 2023, a similar decision was announced for the remaining blast furnaces operated by British Steel, although the planned switch date of 2025 may be set back due to grid connection delays (Gill, 2024). This marks a transition away from coal in steelmaking which will reduce emissions.

However, there has not yet been sufficient planning on how to ensure a just transition which preserves jobs in local communities dependent on steelmaking. This is a critical gap that must be addressed. There is also a need to drive industrial electrification in a more systematic way, with electricity prices still too high when compared to fossil gas (CCC, 2024).

**Carbon capture and storage**

The previous government set an aim of delivering 6 MtCO2/yr of industrial CCS by 2030, and 9 MtCO2/yr by 2035. This represents around 17% of total abatement in the industrial sector by 2035 (CCC, 2023a). The new government has continued this commitment to CCS, pledging GBP 22 bn of funding to drive CCS projects over the next 25 years (UK Government, 2024). Relying too heavily on CCS to deliver emissions reductions in the industrial sector could be risky, as the majority of previous CCS projects have ended in failure (Abdulla et al., 2020). In many sectors, the role and value of CCS is also being eroded as the cost of renewables declines (Grant, Hawkes, Napp, et al., 2021). CCS should be prioritised for applications where there are few alternatives, such as cement production (E3G, 2023).

**Fossil fuel supply**

Achieving the UK’s climate targets will require strong and sustained reductions in oil and gas production, as well as improvements to the emissions intensity of any remaining extraction. Oil and gas demand will need to fall around 30% by 2030 to achieve the UK’s NDC (CCC, 2020). The CCC also suggested that the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction should fall 68% by 2030, through electrification of processes and addressing fugitive emissions (CCC, 2020).

The previous UK government moved in the opposite direction, continuing to support new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, approving the Abigail, Jackdaw and Talbot fields (Oil and Gas Authority, 2023; A. Thomas, 2022; Tidman, 2022). New licensing rounds were held annually (UK Government, 2023a).

The incoming government has set a new direction, committing to end licensing for new oil and gas fields (Lempriere, 2024). This is a good start and should be welcomed. However, it does not address the substantial pipeline of projects which have already received exploration licenses and are either waiting for development consent or are already in production. There are thirteen such projects awaiting approval (Dunne, 2024).

The new government could strengthen its position on oil and gas by publicly committing to not approve this remaining pipeline of projects, and also set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals, for example joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).


## Transport

The transport sector is the largest source of emissions in the UK, representing 29% of emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Central to decarbonising transport is ending the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans by 2030 and fossil fuelled heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2035–40 (Department for Transport, 2021).

The policy context that the new UK government has inherited is mixed. On the one hand, the previous government confirmed the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2023, which sets minimum EV sales targets for each vehicle manufacturer and will be a key delivery mechanism in scaling up EV sales (UK Government, 2023b). At the same time, the government pushed back the date of the sales ban on internal combustion engine cars from 2030 to 2035, sending a very mixed signal to the public and automotive industry. In 2023, the share of electric car sales in the UK failed to grow, flatlining at 16.5% and falling off track for the UK’s transition for the first time (SMMT, 2024). The share of electric van sales is growing much more slowly and is significantly off-track (CCC, 2024).

Key actions for the new government should include:

- **Reinstating the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales**
- **Taking action to help accelerate EV rollout**. This should include removing barriers for the installation of EV chargers and working with major van fleet operators to understand barriers to EV uptake.
**Aviation**

In 2022, the UK released its Jet Zero Strategy which aims to reduce emissions from this sector to net zero (Department for Transport, 2022). This aims for domestic aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and total aviation emissions to reach net zero by 2050.

However, in this context, net zero does not mean eliminating the negative climate impacts of aviation, but rather allowing for a large-scale growth in emissions that would be compensated for via the UK emissions trading scheme, CORSIA and other offsetting mechanisms outside the aviation sector. The strategy also ignores the non-CO2 impact of aviation, which represents up to two-thirds of the sector’s overall climate impact (Lee et al., 2021).

The UK’s current strategy relies heavily on speculative technological innovation and carbon dioxide removal to enable a ‘net zero’ aviation sector, without addressing the elephant in the room – demand.

The previous government committed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would provide 10% of overall fuel use by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040 (UK Department for Transport, 2024). This is five times the level included in the CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway and would require an unprecedented scale-up of SAF production. The new government confirmed this commitment, and introduced a SAF mandate to drive this uptake (Department for Transport, 2024). There will also be a revenue certainty mechanism to provide confidence to investors seeking to build SAF plants to meet UK demand. However, SAF deployment remains very low globally and has consistently failed to meet expectations (Rutherford, 2022). Relying so heavily on this option therefore represents a major delivery risk.

The Jet Zero strategy also fails to address demand. The Government states that “the sector can achieve Jet Zero without the government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth” (Department for Transport, 2022), and envisages that passenger numbers could rise 70% from 2021 to 2050. This is in contrast to the CCC’s advice, which was that no net expansion in airport capacity should be permitted, and passenger growth should be 25% at most (CCC, 2020). Numerous airports are currently planning expansions or have received approval to expand in the past two years (AEF, 2022) which again could threaten the UK’s ability to achieve its climate targets. As yet, the new government has not provided any clear commitments that it will curb aviation demand, with the chancellor repeatedly mentioning aviation as a key engine of economic growth (Topham, 2024).

As a result, in 2050, the Jet Zero strategy expects that aviation will still be emitting around 19 MtCO2 per year, which will need to be compensated for by CO2 removal. Given the very limited potential for CO2 removal and uncertainties in the climate system, CO2 removal should be reserved to hedge against climate uncertainties and balance out truly hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g. from agriculture), rather than to facilitate a stark increase in aviation emissions in one of the world’s wealthiest countries.

For more information on the need to align aviation and shipping emissions with the Paris Agreement, see the sectoral pages oninternational aviation and international shipping.


## Buildings

Buildings were responsible for 20% of UK emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Emissions fell strongly in 2023 by 7.2% relative to 2022, due to reductions in gas demand (CCC, 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this was due to gas prices (which remain above the levels seen before the fossil gas energy crisis) or due to other drivers. Importantly, key indicators for tracking buildings decarbonisation, including the rate of heat pump installations and the rate of energy efficiency installations, are lagging far behind the level needed.

The number of heat pumps installed in 2023 increased only 4% from 2022 (CCC, 2024). The growth rate should be nearer 40–50% per year, if the number of annual installations is to reach 600,000–900,000 by 2030. Meanwhile the number of energy efficiency installations driven by government schemes fell in 2023, moving significantly off-track. This suggests that, without government action, the emissions reductions seen in 2023 will not be sustained into the future.

Priority actions for the new government should include:

- **Introducing a comprehensive programme for decarbonising public sector buildings**. Public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings represent a low-hanging fruit which could deliver substantial emissions reductions quickly.
- **Removing planning barriers to heat pumps**. The previous Government proposed such changes which would make it easier to install heat pumps (DLUHC, 2024). The new government should implement these changes immediately.
- **Re-introducing obligations for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented homes.** The new government has committed to do this in its manifesto – it must now turn this ambition into action.
- **Removing the exemption of 20% of houses from the fossil-fuel boiler installation phase-out**. The previous government introduced this exemption, suggesting that it would save money. However, maintaining the gas distribution network for such a small set of households would likely increase, not reduce costs.

## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for 12% of UK emissions in 2022 (DESNZ, 2024a). There has been essentially no progress made in agricultural decarbonisation over the past decade, with emissions in 2022 at the same level as in 2012.

In many places, the existing policy portfolio for agricultural decarbonisation is “too little, too late”. There is still no ban on the use of peat in gardening products, and plans to introduce methane-supressing feed products by 2030 are too late.

Key actions for the new government include:

- **Introducing policies to hedge against the risk of delivery failure**. The existing approach to agricultural decarbonisation has relied heavily on measures which are technological and voluntary in nature: this is a significant delivery risk. Productivity improvements on their own will not necessarily reduce emissions, with a risk that farmers simply increase herd numbers instead of freeing up land. Policies need to be developed to address these risks.
- **Introducing measures to** **address dietary change and food waste prevention**. The existing Government Food Strategy does not introduce measures to support and accelerate dietary shifts, despite the clear health benefits of doing so, and the evidence of consumer appetite for reduced meat consumption (Stewart et al., 2021; UK Government, 2022). The Food Strategy also only addressed food waste from large businesses, despite the majority of food waste occurring at the household, farm and supply-chain stages.
The UK has one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe, at 13% (Forest Research, 2023). The UK has set a target of planting 30,000 ha/yr of new woodland by 2025, which is aligned with the CCC’s recommendations. However, planting rates in 2023 were under half of this level (Forest Research, 2023).

It is essential that the new government takes action to accelerate tree planting. This will require new delivery mechanisms, complete with the required rates of funding. In particular, there is a need to provide clear long-term funding, and to streamline processes in order to draw in private capital.

Progress in protecting and restoring degraded peatland is also significantly off track. The Climate Change Committee recommends that over 60,000 ha/yr of peatland is restored from 2025 onwards. But in 2022/23, only 13,000 ha were restored – less than a fifth of recommended levels (CCC, 2023a). Key policy gaps include restrictions on the burning of peatland, as much peatland remains unprotected by current legislation, and a faster phase-out for peat in horticultural products, as the sale of peat will currently only be fully banned by 2030 (The Wildlife Trusts, 2023).


## Methane

14% of the UK’s total emissions in 2022 came from methane (DESNZ, 2024a), with 80% of these emissions coming from agriculture and waste. The UK is also a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, which sets a target of reducing methane emissions by 30% over 2020–2030. However, to date methane emission reductions are not happening fast enough in the UK. On average, methane emissions fell 0.9 MtCO2e/yr over 2015–2022. This would need to double to over 1.9 Mt CO2e/yr to reach the current 2030 targets.

Key actions for the government to take include:

- **Publishing plans to capture methane emissions** from landfill sites, as well as improving the monitoring of landfill emissions.
- **Develop plans to reduce methane emissions from agriculture**. This should include accelerating the deployment of methane-supressing feed products within the industry, as well as promoting measures to cut demand for meat and dairy.
- **Track, monitor and transparently report** on the UK’s progress towards the Global Methane Pledge.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data for 1990–2021 were obtained from the UK Government (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023a). Provisional emissions data for 2022 was also included to extend the time series to 2021 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023b). The UK provides inventory data to the UNFCCC that includes emissions from Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which are not covered by UK climate policy and are not included in government emission projections. For this reason, we have chosen to use national emissions statistics rather than UNFCCC inventory emissions.


## NDC and other targets

The UK’s 2030 NDC target of at least a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is expressed using 100 year global warming potentials (GWP100) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Government of the UK, 2022). In addition, the UK Government has specified that the target reference year includes F-gas emissions from 1995. Thus, to quantify the expected 2030 emissions, we apply the 68% reduction to a reference emissions level consisting of the UK’s emissions in 1990 but including F-gas from 1995 instead of 1990, all expressed in AR5 GWPs.

As the CAT presents all data across countries in GWP from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the 2030 emissions implied by the NDC target in AR5 GWPs are then converted back into AR4 GWP. This is done by calculating a historical conversion factor from AR5 GWPs to AR4 GWPs, using historical data from 2021. This conversion factor can then be used to calculate the NDC in 2030 in AR4 GWPs.

The UK’s 2030 (NDC) and 2035 (Sixth Carbon Budget) emissions targets includes LULUCF emissions. This needs to be subtracted for comparability with other countries. We use projections from the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget to estimate LULUCF emissions in 2030 and 2035 (CCC, 2020). While the government’s approach to achieving the NDC and Sixth Carbon Budget differs somewhat from the CCC, there is strong alignment on afforestation pledges, and so LULUCF emissions will likely be closely aligned with the CCC’s projections, if these targets are to be met.

The UK’s 2035 emissions target additionally includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. These emissions were added to the 1990 baseline when calculating what a 78% reduction would entail. Projected 2035 emissions from international aviation and shipping were then removed from the implied 2035 target, as these emissions are captured under our IMO and ICAO assessments and would be double counted if they remained as part of the UK’s total emissions. Data is taken from the UK’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (DESNZ, 2023a).

The UK’s 2050 net-zero target also includes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, which need to be removed. In the absence of long-term projections from the UK Government, we use the Sixth Carbon Budget to calculate LULUCF and international shipping emissions in 2050, while the high ambition scenario from the recent Jet Zero strategy is used to estimate aviation emissions in 2050 (CCC, 2020; Department for Transport, 2022).


## Current policy projections

NOTE: Current policy projections for the UK have not been updated since the September 2023 CAT profile. A new current policy projection will be quantified in 2025.

To estimate current policy projections, we use the 2023 progress report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC, 2023a). In this report, the CCC estimates the impact of current UK policies on emissions. Policies are ranked as ‘credible’, displaying ‘some risks’ to delivery, displaying ‘significant risks’ to delivery, or ‘insufficient’.

To calculate the upper range of the current policies trajectory, we take the impact of all credible policies. These are policies where there are proven delivery mechanisms, a credible combination of public/private financing and clear timelines in place. The resulting emissions savings come predominantly from the zero-emissions vehicle mandate to drive EV sales and the renewable electricity supply policies in the power sector. To estimate the lower end of the current policy trajectory, we additionally include the impact of all policies ranked as displaying ‘some risks’. These include policies around home decarbonisation, industrial CCS, hydrogen, and also some policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors.

The CCC estimates that in 2030, there are credible policies to cut emissions by 42 MtCO2e, relative to the baseline. Policies with some risks to delivery could cut emissions by a further 51 MtCO2e in 2030. This gives an emissions level in 2030 (converting to AR4 GWPs and removing international aviation and shipping and LULUCF emissions, all of which are included in the CCC’s estimates) of 340–394 MtCO2e.

The conversion from AR5 to AR4 GWPs is done in the same way as when calculating the UK’s emissions targets, by calculating the ratio between AR5 and AR4 GWPs for 2021. Future LULUCF and international bunker emissions are taken from the UK’s Net Zero Strategy (UK Government, 2021b).

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UK has set a target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target includes international aviation and shipping (IAS) emissions, as well as LULUCF emissions and removals from BECCS/DACCS (UK Government, 2019d). The CAT assesses IAS and LULUCF separately, and therefore these need to be removed from the projections.

The UK Government does not provide detail on the LULUCF emissions they assume in 2050. In the absence of this, we take analysis from the CCC, which suggested that in the Balanced Net Zero pathway which reaches net zero by 2050, LULUCF emissions would be -19 MtCO2/yr (CCC, 2020). We also use this source to estimate future emissions from IAS. In the Balanced Net Zero pathway, emissions from aviation and shipping in 2050 are 24 MtCO2. Assuming an equal split between international and domestic aviation/shipping in 2050 as in 2019, this means that in 2050, IAS emissions would be 19 MtCO2/yr.

Under these assumptions, the UK’s net zero target remains a 0 MtCO2e target in 2050 once LULUCF and IAS have been removed. However, in reality, the UK Government intends residual emissions to fall to around 70-80 MtCO2e/yr, with engineered removals from BECCS/DACCS offsetting these remaining emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In 2020, the UK updated its 2030 NDC to reduce GHG emissions by at least 68% below 1990 levels (including LULUCF and excluding international aviation and shipping). This is an increase on the previous target of a 57% reduction below 1990 levels. The UK also set a 2035 target to reduce emissions by 78% below 1990 levels including both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping. The CAT excludes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping from its analysis. Converting to this basis, the UK’s targets are to reduce emissions by 68% and 82% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 2035 respectively.

In 2019, the UK increased the ambition of its 2050 target to net zero GHG emissions (UK Government, 2019d).

*The CAT focuses on future emissions excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping (international bunker) emissions. The UK’s net zero target covers both LULUCF and international bunkers. The CCC’s path for reaching net zero by 2050 involves residual emissions of ~19 MtCO2e from international bunkers, and also a 19 MtCO2e sink from the LULUCF sector. These offset one another so that 2050 emissions remain at 0 MtCO2e. However, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions, with residual emissions from aviation and other sectors balanced by removals from LULUCF and engineered CO2 removal.


## NDC updates

**2030 NDC targets**

On 12 December 2020, the UK submitted its first updated NDC to the UNFCCC after leaving the European Union. This NDC commits the UK to reducing GHG emissions to 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. This represents a significant strengthening from the UK’s previous 2030 commitment, which was to reduce emissions by 57% below 1990 levels. The UK’s NDC is now aligned with its 2050 target of achieving net zero GHG emissions, according to analysis by the CCC (CCC, 2020).

The UK’s NDC is not fully aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways. This represents a downgrade from previous CAT analyses (from 2022 and earlier), due to the use of more recent global pathways aligned with 1.5ºC. A further strengthening of the UK’s NDC is therefore necessary to align with the latest evidence coming from least-cost modelled 1.5°C compatible domestic pathways. Strengthening the UK’s NDC would also better enable the UK to embody the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities that are central to the Paris Agreement.

Analysis has shown that an emissions reductions target of up to 70% (CCC, 2020) and towards 75% would be achievable (WWF, 2020). However, each day of delay makes achieving deep emission reductions much more challenging.

The UK revisited and updated its NDC on 23 September 2022 (Government of the UK, 2022). The UK did not strengthen the overall GHG emissions reductions target, as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 under the UK’s presidency. It did, however, provide a range of additional information to increase clarity, transparency and understanding.

This includes information on how the UK will deliver its NDC by 2030, how it will assess the NDC’s achievement, an update on the NDC’s territorial scope (which includes the Crown Territory of Jersey and Overseas Dependency of Gibraltar), and more information on how the UK’s climate targets relate to broader goals around gender, green skills, a just transition, biodiversity, health, air pollution and public engagement.

However, without strengthening the level of ambition in its NDC and providing increased levels of climate finance to support emissions reductions in less wealthy countries, the UK will be unable to improve its rating on the Climate Action Tracker.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as "Almost Sufficient". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC.

The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to "Almost Sufficient". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO2e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond.

Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action.

The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011).

The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable.

The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by:

- Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026
- Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors)
- Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026
**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Summary


## Overview

**The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential.**

**As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such,** **we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed** **from** **the new government’s climate action.** **We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025.**

**The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate.** **This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government.**

**The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country.**

A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030.

However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should:

- Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved.
- Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which:

- goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC,
- considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and
- sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms.
This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK.

However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration.

The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation pathways.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement**.** We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as "Almost Sufficient".

However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as "Insufficient".

Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased.

Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to "1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible" include:

- Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC.
- Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets.
- Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts.
We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context.

In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025.

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables.
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses.

However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

The full analysis of the UK’s policies and action is here.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being "Almost Sufficient" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway).

If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: The new UK government has yet to amend or update the UK’s existing net zero target. As such, the evaluation of the UK’s net zero target here refers to the existing targets and architecture set up by the previous government.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK and a delineation of separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases, including emissions from international aviation and shipping. The net zero target’s key strength is its periodic carbon budgets and associated intermediate targets: by means of five-year statutory carbon budgets, a clear timeline is provided that will facilitate the tracking of progress towards net zero.

Some explanation on why the target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The UK aims to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (UK Government 2021b).
- **International aviation and shipping** –The Climate Change Act itself does not yet specify whether emissions from international aviation and shipping are included in the new 2050 target. However, the sixth carbon budget will count emissions from international aviation and shipping towards the UK’s emissions (UK Government 2021d). As the 2050 target will be achieved via carbon budgets, the inclusion of aviation and shipping in the sixth carbon budget suggests that the 2050 target will also account for international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – When introducing the net zero target in 2019, the Prime Minister’s office announced that the UK “will retain the ability to use international carbon credits […] to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation” (UK Government 2019b). However, around the same time, the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy specifically stated, in an answer given to a question in parliament, that the government did not intend to use international credits to achieve its net zero target (UK Government 2019a). Given the contradicting nature of official statements relating to this indicator, an “poor” rating has been assigned to the UK. However, this would be changed to a positive rating upon an official commitment to rule out the use of international credits, which was not present in the latest description of the UK's net zero targets (DESNZ 2023a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The UK’s 2050 target was enshrined in law in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The intermediate emissions targets, in the form of carbon budgets are also legislated for and legally binding. The UK has also submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy (UK Government 2021b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy includes several scenarios with varying levels of negative emissions in 2050 (UK Government 2021b), but does not set specific emissions reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – The UK has a legally binding process in place to review progress on achieving the net zero target (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee 2021). The Secretary of State is obliged to provide an annual statement on UK emissions trends, as well as a statement on whether each successive carbon budget has been met. There is also a provision that allows for the amendment of the 2050 target if there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change or in international law or policy.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** **–** In the Net Zero Strategy, the UK government has outlined the ranges of removals expected in 2050 from both bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). The Government aims to remove 75–81 MtCO2 by 2050 by these methods, which is more than suggested by the CCC (UK Government 2021b, CCC 2020). Updated estimates of 2050 carbon dioxide removal levels were not provided in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which considers only the period out to 2037.While transparent communication is to be welcomed, the UK’s target therefore displays a considerable reliance on removals, which could pose a delivery risk, due to the uncertainty around the technical feasibility of engineered CO2 removal (Grant et al 2021a). The Net Zero strategy does consider how CO2 storage potential could constrain carbon dioxide removal via BECCS and DACCS. This could represent a short-term constraint on CO2 removal in the 2030s (UK Government 2021b). The Government is working to develop CO2 storage infrastructure, including by developing a business model to incentivise the transport and storage of CO2.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy from October 2021 provides a range of sector-specific pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 (UK Government 2021b). The Climate Change Act’s legally binding carbon budgets provide a clear timeline that will help track progress towards net zero. In this way, the UK has some of the key elements of good practice in the area of comprehensive planning to reach net zero. The updated Carbon Budget Delivery Plan sets a new standard in transparency around the government’s plans to reduce emissions in line with net zero (DESNZ 2023a). This improved transparency, while welcome, has highlighted a large number of critical policy gaps in the UK’s pathway towards net zero. With only 24–32% of the necessary emissions reductions covered by credible policy, the UK’s current approach cannot be deemed credible, unless further action is taken (CCC 2023a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The CCC’s advice includes an assessment of the implications of different equity principles. The report concludes that the UK would have to do more than the world as a whole for its target to be considered ambitious and aligned fair share principles (CCC 2020). The report goes on to explain how the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target could be addressed. However, the Climate Change Act itself does not reference fairness nor equity in the context of its net zero target, neither does the Net Zero Strategy itself.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The UK’s 2035 target in its new NDC is ambitious and would translate to emissions below our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathway (MDP). Given that the 2035 target can also be reasonably achieved from the 2030 target, we label the UK’s new NDC as “1.5°C compatible” against MDPs. We welcome this proposed emissions cut for 2035 on the road to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and it is the first developed country to get this assessment.

At the same time, some key issues should be highlighted:

- First, the UK should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The UK’s current 2030 climate target of a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is very close to the 70% cut needed to align with these pathways. In 2023, UK emissions were estimated to already be 53% below 1990 levels. Updating the 2030 target could be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets also.
- Second, the UK should consider going beyond the minimum targets set by MDPs which are a floor, not a ceiling of ambition.
- While this 2035 target aligns with cost-effective pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically. The UK should therefore increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally, and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- What matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. The new government has inherited a vast implementation gap, with existing policies covering only 24% of the emission reductions needed to meet the new 2035 target. Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this new ambition into reality.
- The UK should not be developing new oil and gas resources and needs to progress its phase out of fossil fuels beyond coal. Leadership is badly needed on this issue globally and it is very bad signal if the UK follows the US Trump Administration on this issue.
The UK submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 30 January 2025 setting a target to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 keeping the same headline ambition that it announced at COP29. This target covers all sectors and all gases. With its 2035 target of 153 MtCO2e, the UK has closed the gap between its target and our 1.5°C compatible MDP in 2035 and gone slightly below the threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UK’s 2035 target is in the right ballpark for a cost-effective path to 1.5ºC. There’s also good detail on the current policy mix being implemented to cut emissions. We have the destination, and we have the tools to get there. What we now need is a detailed roadmap, breaking down sector by sector what the UK’s targets will be to achieve these emissions reductions. An updated net zero strategy will be published in “due course”, with full detail of policy packages across all sectors. The CAT is ready and waiting to evaluate this when it emerges.

The submitted NDC of 153 MtCO2e in 2035 is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is slightly below the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, however, the UK's its 2030 target of 253 MtCO2e is still slightly above the 236 MtCO2e threshold for 1.5°C MDP excluding LULUCF.

The 2035 NDC target includes detail on the actions being taken in different sectors to reduce emissions. This includes a commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, to achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030, and to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles via the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy. These plans align with the UK’s commitments under the Global Stocktake (GST).

The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with the CAT’s own power sector benchmarks, which found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs that are at least aligned with globally cost-effective 1.5ºC pathways, and should communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.

Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. The UK has communicated that it intends to honour the commitment made by the previous government to spend GBP 11.6bn between 2021 and 2026, with at least GBP 3bn of this going to nature. This will be challenging, due to the systemic underspending on climate finance between 2021–2024, but is a welcome confirmation.

The UK then needs to commit to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026, as its 2030 and 2035 NDCs do not align with its fair share of global mitigation, and its provision of finance is currently rated as “Highly Insufficient."


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the huge emissions gap between current policies and a 1.5°C pathway. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The UK’s NDC fits within its institutional framework for planning, delivering and monitoring emission reductions. As such, it is a broadly credible document which demonstrates how planning and monitoring can help deliver on the commitments made.

However, planning and monitoring can only get you so far. Ultimately what is needed is action, and fast. The UK government inherited a vast implementation gap from the previous administration, with only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s NDC covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024). While the Government has made steps in addressing this, much more will need to be done.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The UK has often been a leader in the transparency of its communications to the UNFCCC. While this NDC provides a large amount of detail, the UK has missed the opportunity to provide clarity in three key areas: LULUCF, carbon removal, and carbon credits. The UK’s LULUCF emissions are very small compared to total emissions (at less than 1% of total emissions in 2022), and so the lack of clarity on LULUCF is perhaps less of an issue.

However, the UK has been criticised for relying too heavily on carbon dioxide removal in its long-term strategy and net-zero targets. In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.

# Policies & action

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The new government needs to take rapid action to develop and implement climate policies to reduce emissions. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emissions reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

The UK’s stalled progress in climate policy development over recent years means that, without immediate and rapid change, the UK can no longer be considered a leader in global climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The new government has strongly indicated that it intends to address this policy shortfall, introducing new funding and delivery mechanisms to close the gap. The CAT will be tracking these policy developments and provide an updated assessment of the progress made in 2025.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.


## Policy overview

The new government has inherited a challenging policy context. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays to key delivery mechanisms, rollbacks to other essential climate polices, and a clear lack of commitment to reducing emissions at the pace and scale needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. As a result, in July 2024, only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to reach the UK’s climate targets were covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024).

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind (DESNZ, 2024c) and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables (DESNZ, 2024a, 2024d).
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements (Seddon, 2024), has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (DESNZ, 2024b) (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest renewable auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is still not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise industrial electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentive industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. These policy rollbacks should be reversed.

## Power sector

The UK’s power sector crossed a milestone in October 2024 when the last coal-fired power station shut down. Rapid growth in renewables has phased out coal without increasing demand for fossil gas generation. In 2023, almost half of the UK’s electricity came from renewables, with a third of generation from wind and solar alone.

The focus must now turn to phasing out fossil gas. The UK has a target of achieving clean power by 2030 – this is a laudable goal which would put the UK at the forefront of the global power sector transition and demonstrate the viability of a fully decarbonised power sector to all.

**Coal**

The UK’s last coal-fired power station closed in October 2024, marking the end of an era. This historic moment puts the UK as a front-runner in the transition away from coal in the power sector, phasing out coal six years ahead of the 2030 deadline for developed countries (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

The UK’s coal exit is one of its main climate policy success stories of the past decade. As recently as 2012, coal provided 40% of the UK electricity mix (Ember, 2023). The rapid phase-out of coal means that power sector emissions fell on average by 10% each year between 2012–2022 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023).

**Fossil gas and oil**

The new UK government has a target to achieve “clean power” by 2030. While it has not provided the exact definition of clean power, this ultimately must involve phasing out fossil gas in the power sector. The CAT has found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with these benchmarks. Detailed modelling has shown that it is possible to push fossil gas out of the electricity system (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

It is unlikely that the UK will be able to fully phase out fossil gas in the electricity mix by 2030. However, it is possible to substantially cut gas demand. Detailed modelling highlights that the share of gas in the electricity system could fall to below 2% by 2030 without compromising security of supply (Ember, 2022). Keeping some of the fossil gas fleet as a “cold reserve” to provide very limited generation in periods of low renewable supply could help maintain energy security in the UK, while having a minimal impact on emissions. This fossil gas could then be fully phased out as alternative options to provide this back-up generation are deployed.

There is a wide range of options that can help balance a clean grid, including batteries, hydrogen, pumped storage, interconnectors and demand-side management. As such, fossil gas with CCS should play, at most, a minimal role in the power sector. Detailed modelling suggests that the UK could meet future electricity demand reliably in a grid dominated by wind and solar, with as little as 2.6 GW of fossil gas with CCS in the power sector in 2030, and only 0–5 GW by 2035 (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

Current CCS projects under development would be sufficient to reach this level. The UK should avoid embarking on a path of heavy reliance on fossil gas with CCS in the power sector, focussing instead on other measures to provide reliable zero-carbon electricity. Deploying turbines which can run on green hydrogen would be a key way to provide long-term flexible electricity generation without relying on CCS.

**Renewables**

The UK government is aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to support its goal of clean power by 2030 (Parkinson, 2024). Turbocharging renewables will be crucial to aligning with 1.5ºC, with the CAT finding that in the UK, the share of renewables in the power sector should reach 84–93% by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s goal of clean power by 2030 would align with this, depending on the exact assumptions made about the role of nuclear power in the electricity system.

Getting sufficient renewables capacity connected to the grid and generating before 2030 will be a herculean challenge. The UK has a range of policies to support renewables deployment. The central policy is the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme, which offers a guaranteed price to renewable generators over their lifetime, with the price set by reverse auctions. This has encouraged competition and innovation in the sector and driven large-scale investment and deployment. Wind capacity more than doubled in the past decade to 30 GW in 2023, while solar capacity grew from 3 GW in 2013 to 16 GW in 2022 (Ember, 2023).

However, as of July 2024, there were around 30 GW of offshore wind either in operation or in active development of some form (Ember, 2024). Given the lead time for offshore wind projects, this would mean that the 2024/2025 auctions would need to achieve over 20 GW of offshore wind deployment to keep the power sector on track for the 2030 goals (Ember, 2024). The 2024 auction achieved only 5 GW, putting offshore wind deployment in the UK significantly off track for the governments’ aims, and making the 2025 auction a critical policy milestone. Onshore wind and solar PV installation rates are also off track. The new government will need to move fast to try and address these issues and get renewables deployed at the pace and scale needed for its 100% clean power goal.


## Industry

The UK’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy introduced by the previous government (UK Government, 2021a) aims to reduce industrial emissions by two-thirds below 2018 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050. While emissions fell 3% in 2022 to 63 MtCO2e, they will need to fall much faster, by around 8% per year, to achieve the government’s climate targets (CCC, 2023a).

The strategy has a three-pronged approach: switching to low carbon fuels, efficiency gains, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). While some action is beginning to occur on fuel-switching, in particular in the electrification of steel, there remain significant gaps in the policies supporting resource efficiency in the industrial sector (CCC, 2024).

**Fuel switching**

In 2023, over 50% of industrial final energy was provided directly by fossil fuels (DESNZ, 2024c). This will need to be reduced substantially on the path to net zero. Two key options are the use of hydrogen, and direct electrification.

The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy sets a target of 50 TWh of fossil fuels to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives by 2035 in the manufacturing sector (UK Government, 2021a). This is roughly a third of industrial fossil consumption in 2022. To support this target, the previous government introduced the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme.

This is similar to the CfD scheme in the power sector, providing financial support to cover the additional cost of low-carbon hydrogen production. GBP 140m was allocated to support fuel-switching over 2023–2024. This provides a business model to support industrial fuel-switching to hydrogen and is a positive step. There is also a GBP 240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (DESNZ, 2023). While these funds are to be welcomed, they are much smaller than the scale of funds being offered in Europe to support hydrogen deployment (Abnett, 2023).

Industrial electrification has taken a step forwards in the UK, with the agreement of a deal to transform the Tata steelworks from a coal-fired blast furnace to an electric arc furnace producing recycled steel (H. Thomas & Browne, 2024). In November 2023, a similar decision was announced for the remaining blast furnaces operated by British Steel, although the planned switch date of 2025 may be set back due to grid connection delays (Gill, 2024). This marks a transition away from coal in steelmaking which will reduce emissions.

However, there has not yet been sufficient planning on how to ensure a just transition which preserves jobs in local communities dependent on steelmaking. This is a critical gap that must be addressed. There is also a need to drive industrial electrification in a more systematic way, with electricity prices still too high when compared to fossil gas (CCC, 2024).

**Carbon capture and storage**

The previous government set an aim of delivering 6 MtCO2/yr of industrial CCS by 2030, and 9 MtCO2/yr by 2035. This represents around 17% of total abatement in the industrial sector by 2035 (CCC, 2023a). The new government has continued this commitment to CCS, pledging GBP 22 bn of funding to drive CCS projects over the next 25 years (UK Government, 2024). Relying too heavily on CCS to deliver emissions reductions in the industrial sector could be risky, as the majority of previous CCS projects have ended in failure (Abdulla et al., 2020). In many sectors, the role and value of CCS is also being eroded as the cost of renewables declines (Grant, Hawkes, Napp, et al., 2021). CCS should be prioritised for applications where there are few alternatives, such as cement production (E3G, 2023).

**Fossil fuel supply**

Achieving the UK’s climate targets will require strong and sustained reductions in oil and gas production, as well as improvements to the emissions intensity of any remaining extraction. Oil and gas demand will need to fall around 30% by 2030 to achieve the UK’s NDC (CCC, 2020). The CCC also suggested that the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction should fall 68% by 2030, through electrification of processes and addressing fugitive emissions (CCC, 2020).

The previous UK government moved in the opposite direction, continuing to support new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, approving the Abigail, Jackdaw and Talbot fields (Oil and Gas Authority, 2023; A. Thomas, 2022; Tidman, 2022). New licensing rounds were held annually (UK Government, 2023a).

The incoming government has set a new direction, committing to end licensing for new oil and gas fields (Lempriere, 2024). This is a good start and should be welcomed. However, it does not address the substantial pipeline of projects which have already received exploration licenses and are either waiting for development consent or are already in production. There are thirteen such projects awaiting approval (Dunne, 2024).

The new government could strengthen its position on oil and gas by publicly committing to not approve this remaining pipeline of projects, and also set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals, for example joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).


## Transport

The transport sector is the largest source of emissions in the UK, representing 29% of emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Central to decarbonising transport is ending the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans by 2030 and fossil fuelled heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2035–40 (Department for Transport, 2021).

The policy context that the new UK government has inherited is mixed. On the one hand, the previous government confirmed the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2023, which sets minimum EV sales targets for each vehicle manufacturer and will be a key delivery mechanism in scaling up EV sales (UK Government, 2023b). At the same time, the government pushed back the date of the sales ban on internal combustion engine cars from 2030 to 2035, sending a very mixed signal to the public and automotive industry. In 2023, the share of electric car sales in the UK failed to grow, flatlining at 16.5% and falling off track for the UK’s transition for the first time (SMMT, 2024). The share of electric van sales is growing much more slowly and is significantly off-track (CCC, 2024).

Key actions for the new government should include:

- **Reinstating the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales**
- **Taking action to help accelerate EV rollout**. This should include removing barriers for the installation of EV chargers and working with major van fleet operators to understand barriers to EV uptake.
**Aviation**

In 2022, the UK released its Jet Zero Strategy which aims to reduce emissions from this sector to net zero (Department for Transport, 2022). This aims for domestic aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and total aviation emissions to reach net zero by 2050.

However, in this context, net zero does not mean eliminating the negative climate impacts of aviation, but rather allowing for a large-scale growth in emissions that would be compensated for via the UK emissions trading scheme, CORSIA and other offsetting mechanisms outside the aviation sector. The strategy also ignores the non-CO2 impact of aviation, which represents up to two-thirds of the sector’s overall climate impact (Lee et al., 2021).

The UK’s current strategy relies heavily on speculative technological innovation and carbon dioxide removal to enable a ‘net zero’ aviation sector, without addressing the elephant in the room – demand.

The previous government committed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would provide 10% of overall fuel use by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040 (UK Department for Transport, 2024). This is five times the level included in the CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway and would require an unprecedented scale-up of SAF production. The new government confirmed this commitment, and introduced a SAF mandate to drive this uptake (Department for Transport, 2024). There will also be a revenue certainty mechanism to provide confidence to investors seeking to build SAF plants to meet UK demand. However, SAF deployment remains very low globally and has consistently failed to meet expectations (Rutherford, 2022). Relying so heavily on this option therefore represents a major delivery risk.

The Jet Zero strategy also fails to address demand. The Government states that “the sector can achieve Jet Zero without the government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth” (Department for Transport, 2022), and envisages that passenger numbers could rise 70% from 2021 to 2050. This is in contrast to the CCC’s advice, which was that no net expansion in airport capacity should be permitted, and passenger growth should be 25% at most (CCC, 2020). Numerous airports are currently planning expansions or have received approval to expand in the past two years (AEF, 2022) which again could threaten the UK’s ability to achieve its climate targets. As yet, the new government has not provided any clear commitments that it will curb aviation demand, with the chancellor repeatedly mentioning aviation as a key engine of economic growth (Topham, 2024).

As a result, in 2050, the Jet Zero strategy expects that aviation will still be emitting around 19 MtCO2 per year, which will need to be compensated for by CO2 removal. Given the very limited potential for CO2 removal and uncertainties in the climate system, CO2 removal should be reserved to hedge against climate uncertainties and balance out truly hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g. from agriculture), rather than to facilitate a stark increase in aviation emissions in one of the world’s wealthiest countries.

For more information on the need to align aviation and shipping emissions with the Paris Agreement, see the sectoral pages oninternational aviation and international shipping.


## Buildings

Buildings were responsible for 20% of UK emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Emissions fell strongly in 2023 by 7.2% relative to 2022, due to reductions in gas demand (CCC, 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this was due to gas prices (which remain above the levels seen before the fossil gas energy crisis) or due to other drivers. Importantly, key indicators for tracking buildings decarbonisation, including the rate of heat pump installations and the rate of energy efficiency installations, are lagging far behind the level needed.

The number of heat pumps installed in 2023 increased only 4% from 2022 (CCC, 2024). The growth rate should be nearer 40–50% per year, if the number of annual installations is to reach 600,000–900,000 by 2030. Meanwhile the number of energy efficiency installations driven by government schemes fell in 2023, moving significantly off-track. This suggests that, without government action, the emissions reductions seen in 2023 will not be sustained into the future.

Priority actions for the new government should include:

- **Introducing a comprehensive programme for decarbonising public sector buildings**. Public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings represent a low-hanging fruit which could deliver substantial emissions reductions quickly.
- **Removing planning barriers to heat pumps**. The previous Government proposed such changes which would make it easier to install heat pumps (DLUHC, 2024). The new government should implement these changes immediately.
- **Re-introducing obligations for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented homes.** The new government has committed to do this in its manifesto – it must now turn this ambition into action.
- **Removing the exemption of 20% of houses from the fossil-fuel boiler installation phase-out**. The previous government introduced this exemption, suggesting that it would save money. However, maintaining the gas distribution network for such a small set of households would likely increase, not reduce costs.

## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for 12% of UK emissions in 2022 (DESNZ, 2024a). There has been essentially no progress made in agricultural decarbonisation over the past decade, with emissions in 2022 at the same level as in 2012.

In many places, the existing policy portfolio for agricultural decarbonisation is “too little, too late”. There is still no ban on the use of peat in gardening products, and plans to introduce methane-supressing feed products by 2030 are too late.

Key actions for the new government include:

- **Introducing policies to hedge against the risk of delivery failure**. The existing approach to agricultural decarbonisation has relied heavily on measures which are technological and voluntary in nature: this is a significant delivery risk. Productivity improvements on their own will not necessarily reduce emissions, with a risk that farmers simply increase herd numbers instead of freeing up land. Policies need to be developed to address these risks.
- **Introducing measures to** **address dietary change and food waste prevention**. The existing Government Food Strategy does not introduce measures to support and accelerate dietary shifts, despite the clear health benefits of doing so, and the evidence of consumer appetite for reduced meat consumption (Stewart et al., 2021; UK Government, 2022). The Food Strategy also only addressed food waste from large businesses, despite the majority of food waste occurring at the household, farm and supply-chain stages.
The UK has one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe, at 13% (Forest Research, 2023). The UK has set a target of planting 30,000 ha/yr of new woodland by 2025, which is aligned with the CCC’s recommendations. However, planting rates in 2023 were under half of this level (Forest Research, 2023).

It is essential that the new government takes action to accelerate tree planting. This will require new delivery mechanisms, complete with the required rates of funding. In particular, there is a need to provide clear long-term funding, and to streamline processes in order to draw in private capital.

Progress in protecting and restoring degraded peatland is also significantly off track. The Climate Change Committee recommends that over 60,000 ha/yr of peatland is restored from 2025 onwards. But in 2022/23, only 13,000 ha were restored – less than a fifth of recommended levels (CCC, 2023a). Key policy gaps include restrictions on the burning of peatland, as much peatland remains unprotected by current legislation, and a faster phase-out for peat in horticultural products, as the sale of peat will currently only be fully banned by 2030 (The Wildlife Trusts, 2023).


## Methane

14% of the UK’s total emissions in 2022 came from methane (DESNZ, 2024a), with 80% of these emissions coming from agriculture and waste. The UK is also a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, which sets a target of reducing methane emissions by 30% over 2020–2030. However, to date methane emission reductions are not happening fast enough in the UK. On average, methane emissions fell 0.9 MtCO2e/yr over 2015–2022. This would need to double to over 1.9 Mt CO2e/yr to reach the current 2030 targets.

Key actions for the government to take include:

- **Publishing plans to capture methane emissions** from landfill sites, as well as improving the monitoring of landfill emissions.
- **Develop plans to reduce methane emissions from agriculture**. This should include accelerating the deployment of methane-supressing feed products within the industry, as well as promoting measures to cut demand for meat and dairy.
- **Track, monitor and transparently report** on the UK’s progress towards the Global Methane Pledge.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data for 1990–2021 were obtained from the UK Government (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023a). Provisional emissions data for 2022 was also included to extend the time series to 2021 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023b). The UK provides inventory data to the UNFCCC that includes emissions from Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which are not covered by UK climate policy and are not included in government emission projections. For this reason, we have chosen to use national emissions statistics rather than UNFCCC inventory emissions.


## NDC and other targets

The UK’s 2030 NDC target of at least a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is expressed using 100 year global warming potentials (GWP100) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Government of the UK, 2022). In addition, the UK Government has specified that the target reference year includes F-gas emissions from 1995. Thus, to quantify the expected 2030 emissions, we apply the 68% reduction to a reference emissions level consisting of the UK’s emissions in 1990 but including F-gas from 1995 instead of 1990, all expressed in AR5 GWPs.

As the CAT presents all data across countries in GWP from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the 2030 emissions implied by the NDC target in AR5 GWPs are then converted back into AR4 GWP. This is done by calculating a historical conversion factor from AR5 GWPs to AR4 GWPs, using historical data from 2021. This conversion factor can then be used to calculate the NDC in 2030 in AR4 GWPs.

The UK’s 2030 (NDC) and 2035 (Sixth Carbon Budget) emissions targets includes LULUCF emissions. This needs to be subtracted for comparability with other countries. We use projections from the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget to estimate LULUCF emissions in 2030 and 2035 (CCC, 2020). While the government’s approach to achieving the NDC and Sixth Carbon Budget differs somewhat from the CCC, there is strong alignment on afforestation pledges, and so LULUCF emissions will likely be closely aligned with the CCC’s projections, if these targets are to be met.

The UK’s 2035 emissions target additionally includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. These emissions were added to the 1990 baseline when calculating what a 78% reduction would entail. Projected 2035 emissions from international aviation and shipping were then removed from the implied 2035 target, as these emissions are captured under our IMO and ICAO assessments and would be double counted if they remained as part of the UK’s total emissions. Data is taken from the UK’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (DESNZ, 2023a).

The UK’s 2050 net-zero target also includes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, which need to be removed. In the absence of long-term projections from the UK Government, we use the Sixth Carbon Budget to calculate LULUCF and international shipping emissions in 2050, while the high ambition scenario from the recent Jet Zero strategy is used to estimate aviation emissions in 2050 (CCC, 2020; Department for Transport, 2022).


## Current policy projections

NOTE: Current policy projections for the UK have not been updated since the September 2023 CAT profile. A new current policy projection will be quantified in 2025.

To estimate current policy projections, we use the 2023 progress report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC, 2023a). In this report, the CCC estimates the impact of current UK policies on emissions. Policies are ranked as ‘credible’, displaying ‘some risks’ to delivery, displaying ‘significant risks’ to delivery, or ‘insufficient’.

To calculate the upper range of the current policies trajectory, we take the impact of all credible policies. These are policies where there are proven delivery mechanisms, a credible combination of public/private financing and clear timelines in place. The resulting emissions savings come predominantly from the zero-emissions vehicle mandate to drive EV sales and the renewable electricity supply policies in the power sector. To estimate the lower end of the current policy trajectory, we additionally include the impact of all policies ranked as displaying ‘some risks’. These include policies around home decarbonisation, industrial CCS, hydrogen, and also some policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors.

The CCC estimates that in 2030, there are credible policies to cut emissions by 42 MtCO2e, relative to the baseline. Policies with some risks to delivery could cut emissions by a further 51 MtCO2e in 2030. This gives an emissions level in 2030 (converting to AR4 GWPs and removing international aviation and shipping and LULUCF emissions, all of which are included in the CCC’s estimates) of 340–394 MtCO2e.

The conversion from AR5 to AR4 GWPs is done in the same way as when calculating the UK’s emissions targets, by calculating the ratio between AR5 and AR4 GWPs for 2021. Future LULUCF and international bunker emissions are taken from the UK’s Net Zero Strategy (UK Government, 2021b).

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UK has set a target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target includes international aviation and shipping (IAS) emissions, as well as LULUCF emissions and removals from BECCS/DACCS (UK Government, 2019d). The CAT assesses IAS and LULUCF separately, and therefore these need to be removed from the projections.

The UK Government does not provide detail on the LULUCF emissions they assume in 2050. In the absence of this, we take analysis from the CCC, which suggested that in the Balanced Net Zero pathway which reaches net zero by 2050, LULUCF emissions would be -19 MtCO2/yr (CCC, 2020). We also use this source to estimate future emissions from IAS. In the Balanced Net Zero pathway, emissions from aviation and shipping in 2050 are 24 MtCO2. Assuming an equal split between international and domestic aviation/shipping in 2050 as in 2019, this means that in 2050, IAS emissions would be 19 MtCO2/yr.

Under these assumptions, the UK’s net zero target remains a 0 MtCO2e target in 2050 once LULUCF and IAS have been removed. However, in reality, the UK Government intends residual emissions to fall to around 70-80 MtCO2e/yr, with engineered removals from BECCS/DACCS offsetting these remaining emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In 2020, the UK updated its 2030 NDC to reduce GHG emissions by at least 68% below 1990 levels (including LULUCF and excluding international aviation and shipping). This is an increase on the previous target of a 57% reduction below 1990 levels. The UK also set a 2035 target to reduce emissions by 78% below 1990 levels including both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping. The CAT excludes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping from its analysis. Converting to this basis, the UK’s targets are to reduce emissions by 68% and 82% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 2035 respectively.

In 2019, the UK increased the ambition of its 2050 target to net zero GHG emissions (UK Government, 2019d).

*The CAT focuses on future emissions excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping (international bunker) emissions. The UK’s net zero target covers both LULUCF and international bunkers. The CCC’s path for reaching net zero by 2050 involves residual emissions of ~19 MtCO2e from international bunkers, and also a 19 MtCO2e sink from the LULUCF sector. These offset one another so that 2050 emissions remain at 0 MtCO2e. However, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions, with residual emissions from aviation and other sectors balanced by removals from LULUCF and engineered CO2 removal.


## NDC updates

**2030 NDC targets**

On 12 December 2020, the UK submitted its first updated NDC to the UNFCCC after leaving the European Union. This NDC commits the UK to reducing GHG emissions to 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. This represents a significant strengthening from the UK’s previous 2030 commitment, which was to reduce emissions by 57% below 1990 levels. The UK’s NDC is now aligned with its 2050 target of achieving net zero GHG emissions, according to analysis by the CCC (CCC, 2020).

The UK’s NDC is not fully aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways. This represents a downgrade from previous CAT analyses (from 2022 and earlier), due to the use of more recent global pathways aligned with 1.5ºC. A further strengthening of the UK’s NDC is therefore necessary to align with the latest evidence coming from least-cost modelled 1.5°C compatible domestic pathways. Strengthening the UK’s NDC would also better enable the UK to embody the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities that are central to the Paris Agreement.

Analysis has shown that an emissions reductions target of up to 70% (CCC, 2020) and towards 75% would be achievable (WWF, 2020). However, each day of delay makes achieving deep emission reductions much more challenging.

The UK revisited and updated its NDC on 23 September 2022 (Government of the UK, 2022). The UK did not strengthen the overall GHG emissions reductions target, as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 under the UK’s presidency. It did, however, provide a range of additional information to increase clarity, transparency and understanding.

This includes information on how the UK will deliver its NDC by 2030, how it will assess the NDC’s achievement, an update on the NDC’s territorial scope (which includes the Crown Territory of Jersey and Overseas Dependency of Gibraltar), and more information on how the UK’s climate targets relate to broader goals around gender, green skills, a just transition, biodiversity, health, air pollution and public engagement.

However, without strengthening the level of ambition in its NDC and providing increased levels of climate finance to support emissions reductions in less wealthy countries, the UK will be unable to improve its rating on the Climate Action Tracker.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

**Target development timeline & previous CAT analysis****:**

## CAT rating of targets

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as "Almost Sufficient". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC.

The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to "Almost Sufficient". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO2e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond.

Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action.

The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011).

The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable.

The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by:

- Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026
- Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors)
- Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026
**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Summary


## Overview

**The UK’s new government has an opportunity to rebuild the United Kingdom’s reputation as a climate leader. Any claims to leadership must be demonstrated by a new and ambitious NDC which aligns with 1.5ºC. However, ambition must also be paired with action. With credible policies covering only a third of the required reductions to meet the UK’s current 2030 target, the government needs to move fast in developing and implementing strengthened policies to achieve its climate goals. A significant increase in climate finance provision is also essential.**

**As the new government will take some time to introduce new targets, policies and delivery mechanisms, there have been few material changes to the UK’s emissions trends as of November 2024. As such,** **we have not re-assessed the UK’s climate rating, but provide the CAT’s perspective on what is needed** **from** **the new government’s climate action.** **We will continue to monitor the UK’s climate targets and action, responding to any major announcements and providing an updated rating in 2025.**

**The UK government has an opportunity to be the first developed country to have an NDC that aligns with global least cost pathways towards the 1.5°C limit in the Paris agreement. Its 2030 NDC is only 2% short of the level we calculate would be 1.5°C-consistent and the proposal put forward by the UK’s Climate Change Committee of an 81% reduction for 2035 would be just within the 1.5°C compatible range we estimate.** **This would be an important signal to the world, if backed up by credible policies to meet these goals and close the implementation gap inherited from the previous government.**

**The UK government has also sent an important signal to other industrialised countries by committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses. This would be further enhanced by developing a fossil fuel phase out strategy for the country.**

A 1.5ºC aligned NDC for the UK would involve steep cuts to emissions - at home, starting immediately. To align with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK would need to reduce emissions by at least 70% in 2030 and by at least 78% in 2035, below 1990 levels (and excluding LULUCF). The current 2030 target to cut emissions by 68% should therefore be slightly strengthened and combined with a clear commitment to accelerate emissions cuts post–2030.

However, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically as it needs to increase the climate finance it provides and mobilises for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally. To ensure it provides its fair share of the global effort needed to limit warming to 1.5ºC, the UK should:

- Consider going beyond the minimum targets set by modelled domestic pathways. These pathways are based on global least-cost mitigation, and should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling of ambition. While cutting domestic emissions by more than 70% in 2030 may be challenging, it is possible to cut emissions more than 78% in 2035. The Climate Change Committee’s recommendation of an 81% cut by 2035 is a good start in moving beyond this minimum level, but further reductions could be feasible, and where possible, should be achieved.
- Considerably upscale climate finance provision, to support emissions reductions in developing countries. The previous Government consistently underspent on climate finance and changed the definition of what constitutes climate finance in an attempt to meet the target. Meeting the GBP 11.6 bn pledge on climate finance by 2026 is a bare minimum for the UK’s climate finance reputation. A renewed commitment to climate finance from the UK is critical, particularly in the year of the new collective quantified goal (NCQG) on climate finance.
Adopt an ambitious NDC for both 2030 and 2035 which:

- goes beyond global least-cost pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC,
- considers the UK’s fair share of climate action and
- sets out how the UK will support emissions reductions abroad through international support mechanisms.
This could mark a significant step back towards the table of climate leadership for the UK.

However, ambition will only make a difference if it is translated into action. Recent years saw a backtracking on climate action which will make it harder for the UK to reach its climate targets. While the UK marked a milestone in October 2024, with the end of the era of coal-fired power, emissions reductions outside the power sector have lagged behind the level needed and need urgent acceleration.

The new government has made a promising start in many areas. Lifting the ban on onshore wind and accelerating the deployment of renewables will be critical to achieving the government’s target of a clean power sector by 2030. Committing to end new oil and gas exploration licenses helps turn the UK’s fossil fuel supply policy in the right direction (although more needs to be done, and the UK should set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals). There are also positive commitments around doubling funding for energy efficiency in buildings and other steps in the manifesto. However, much more needs to be done. There are a range of key policy actions that the UK could take to get back on track, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentivise industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. The government should reverse these policy rollbacks.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation pathways.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only took office in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement**.** We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates the UK’s climate targets, policies and finance “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The UK’s 2030 emissions target is not aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways, produced by downscaling integrated assessment model (IAM) pathways to the country level. The UK’s target is therefore rated as "Almost Sufficient".

However, there is a significant gap between targets and current policy trajectories in the UK. Only a third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 target are covered by policies which use proven delivery mechanisms and have sufficient funding to support them. Significant delivery risks remain in many areas, and the UK’s policies and actions are still rated as "Insufficient".

Modelled domestic pathways alone also do not represent a fair emissions reduction pathway for the UK. When considering an equitable allocation of emission reductions across countries, the UK’s targets are far below what would represent a fair contribution. The UK’s climate finance commitments, which could bridge the gap towards a fair distribution of global effort in cutting emissions, are “Highly Insufficient” and need to be urgently increased.

Key measures required for the UK to improve its overall rating to "1.5°C Paris Agreement compatible" include:

- Providing a 2030 and 2035 NDC which fully aligns with modelled domestic pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5ºC.
- Introducing and implementing additional policies, funding and delivery mechanisms to achieve the UK’s climate targets.
- Substantially increasing international climate finance contributions, to ensure the UK is contributing its fair share to global climate mitigation efforts.
We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, a rating that indicates the UK’s climate policies and action need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

Key to rebuilding the UK’s reputation as a climate leader is a renewed focus on climate policy development. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays in introducing new measures to slash emissions and an active weakening of key climate policies. The result was a vast chasm between the UK’s climate ambitions and any real-world action being taken to achieve them. Credible policies, clear timelines, appropriate funding, strategic thinking – all were sorely missing. In our previous assessment, the CAT highlighted that credible policies were in place to provide only 25 / 20% of the reductions needed to meet the UK’s 2030 / 2035 climate targets respectively. While in the remaining months of the previous administration, there were some very minor improvements in climate policy, this was not enough to noticeably change the UK’s policy context.

In July 2024, at the beginning of the new government, credible policies covered only 32 / 24% of the emissions reductions needed for the 2030 / 2035 targets respectively. This change would not be sufficient to improve the UK’s rating of policies and action from “Insufficient”. The new government needs to substantially accelerate policy development to improve this rating. The CAT will be monitoring climate policy development in the UK, and provide a revised rating in 2025.

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables.
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements, has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
In the area of fossil fuel supply, where the government has committed to banning new oil and gas exploration licenses.

However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including the three main points mentioned above in the summary: ramping up renewables, accelerating electrification and reversing recent rollbacks.

The full analysis of the UK’s policies and action is here.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% below 1990 levels as being "Almost Sufficient" to limit warming to 1.5°C, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the UK’s 2030 domestic emissions reduction target of at least 68% (incl. LULUCF) below 1990 levels as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s fair-share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.

These improvements need to come in the form of greater ambition in reducing UK emissions, as well as additional financial support for emissions reductions in developing countries. This is because the UK’s fair share contribution requires reductions that go beyond the minimum level of emissions reductions required inside the UK, based on global least-cost mitigation (modelled domestic pathway).

If all countries followed the UK’s current approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

The UK’s international public climate finance contributions are rated “Highly Insufficient.” The UK contributions to date have been far below its fair share, and the previous government’s decision to pit climate and development funding against one another is deeply regrettable. This needs to be addressed urgently. To improve its rating, the UK needs to increase climate finance substantially. At present, the UK’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates the UK’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK enshrined its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 into law. In 2021, the UK submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy. The net zero target covers most elements, and most could be considered good practice, but some elements still remain undefined or lacking. In particular, a clear delineation of targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the UK’s net zero rating. We evaluate the net zero target as: “Acceptable”.

**For the full analysis click** here**.**


# Net zero targets


## Summary

NOTE: The new UK government has yet to amend or update the UK’s existing net zero target. As such, the evaluation of the UK’s net zero target here refers to the existing targets and architecture set up by the previous government.

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK and a delineation of separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases, including emissions from international aviation and shipping. The net zero target’s key strength is its periodic carbon budgets and associated intermediate targets: by means of five-year statutory carbon budgets, a clear timeline is provided that will facilitate the tracking of progress towards net zero.


## CAT analysis of net zero target

Target covers all GHG emissions

Some information on the anticipated pathway or measures for achieving net zero is available, but with limited detail.

Some explanation on why the target is fair


## Ten key elements

**Scope**

- **Target year** – The UK aims to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050.
- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions and all sectors of the economy (UK Government 2021b).
- **International aviation and shipping** –The Climate Change Act itself does not yet specify whether emissions from international aviation and shipping are included in the new 2050 target. However, the sixth carbon budget will count emissions from international aviation and shipping towards the UK’s emissions (UK Government 2021d). As the 2050 target will be achieved via carbon budgets, the inclusion of aviation and shipping in the sixth carbon budget suggests that the 2050 target will also account for international aviation and shipping.
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – When introducing the net zero target in 2019, the Prime Minister’s office announced that the UK “will retain the ability to use international carbon credits […] to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation” (UK Government 2019b). However, around the same time, the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy specifically stated, in an answer given to a question in parliament, that the government did not intend to use international credits to achieve its net zero target (UK Government 2019a). Given the contradicting nature of official statements relating to this indicator, an “poor” rating has been assigned to the UK. However, this would be changed to a positive rating upon an official commitment to rule out the use of international credits, which was not present in the latest description of the UK's net zero targets (DESNZ 2023a).
**Target architecture**

- **Legal status** – The UK’s 2050 target was enshrined in law in 2019 (UK Government 2019d). The intermediate emissions targets, in the form of carbon budgets are also legislated for and legally binding. The UK has also submitted its Net Zero Strategy to the UNFCCC as a long-term strategy (UK Government 2021b).
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy includes several scenarios with varying levels of negative emissions in 2050 (UK Government 2021b), but does not set specific emissions reduction and removal targets.
- **Review process** – The UK has a legally binding process in place to review progress on achieving the net zero target (House of Commons Public Accounts Committee 2021). The Secretary of State is obliged to provide an annual statement on UK emissions trends, as well as a statement on whether each successive carbon budget has been met. There is also a provision that allows for the amendment of the 2050 target if there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change or in international law or policy.
**Transparency**

- **Carbon dioxide removal** **–** In the Net Zero Strategy, the UK government has outlined the ranges of removals expected in 2050 from both bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). The Government aims to remove 75–81 MtCO2 by 2050 by these methods, which is more than suggested by the CCC (UK Government 2021b, CCC 2020). Updated estimates of 2050 carbon dioxide removal levels were not provided in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan, which considers only the period out to 2037.While transparent communication is to be welcomed, the UK’s target therefore displays a considerable reliance on removals, which could pose a delivery risk, due to the uncertainty around the technical feasibility of engineered CO2 removal (Grant et al 2021a). The Net Zero strategy does consider how CO2 storage potential could constrain carbon dioxide removal via BECCS and DACCS. This could represent a short-term constraint on CO2 removal in the 2030s (UK Government 2021b). The Government is working to develop CO2 storage infrastructure, including by developing a business model to incentivise the transport and storage of CO2.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The UK’s Net Zero Strategy from October 2021 provides a range of sector-specific pathways that achieve net zero by 2050 (UK Government 2021b). The Climate Change Act’s legally binding carbon budgets provide a clear timeline that will help track progress towards net zero. In this way, the UK has some of the key elements of good practice in the area of comprehensive planning to reach net zero. The updated Carbon Budget Delivery Plan sets a new standard in transparency around the government’s plans to reduce emissions in line with net zero (DESNZ 2023a). This improved transparency, while welcome, has highlighted a large number of critical policy gaps in the UK’s pathway towards net zero. With only 24–32% of the necessary emissions reductions covered by credible policy, the UK’s current approach cannot be deemed credible, unless further action is taken (CCC 2023a).
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The CCC’s advice includes an assessment of the implications of different equity principles. The report concludes that the UK would have to do more than the world as a whole for its target to be considered ambitious and aligned fair share principles (CCC 2020). The report goes on to explain how the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target could be addressed. However, the Climate Change Act itself does not reference fairness nor equity in the context of its net zero target, neither does the Net Zero Strategy itself.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The UK’s 2035 target in its new NDC is ambitious and would translate to emissions below our cost-effective 1.5ºC modelled domestic pathway (MDP). Given that the 2035 target can also be reasonably achieved from the 2030 target, we label the UK’s new NDC as “1.5°C compatible” against MDPs. We welcome this proposed emissions cut for 2035 on the road to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and it is the first developed country to get this assessment.

At the same time, some key issues should be highlighted:

- First, the UK should still revise and align its 2030 emissions target with 1.5ºC compatible modelled domestic pathways. The UK’s current 2030 climate target of a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is very close to the 70% cut needed to align with these pathways. In 2023, UK emissions were estimated to already be 53% below 1990 levels. Updating the 2030 target could be key in encouraging and motivating other countries to revisit and update their targets also.
- Second, the UK should consider going beyond the minimum targets set by MDPs which are a floor, not a ceiling of ambition.
- While this 2035 target aligns with cost-effective pathways limiting warming to 1.5ºC, the UK’s fair share of climate action goes far beyond what it does domestically. The UK should therefore increase the climate finance it provides for developing countries in order to facilitate substantial emission reductions internationally, and ultimately communicate this as part of its final NDC.
- What matters most is action to reduce emissions in the real economy. The new government has inherited a vast implementation gap, with existing policies covering only 24% of the emission reductions needed to meet the new 2035 target. Urgent action will be needed to introduce, strengthen and implement policy mechanisms that turn this new ambition into reality.
- The UK should not be developing new oil and gas resources and needs to progress its phase out of fossil fuels beyond coal. Leadership is badly needed on this issue globally and it is very bad signal if the UK follows the US Trump Administration on this issue.
The UK submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 30 January 2025 setting a target to cut emissions to 81% below 1990 levels by 2035 keeping the same headline ambition that it announced at COP29. This target covers all sectors and all gases. With its 2035 target of 153 MtCO2e, the UK has closed the gap between its target and our 1.5°C compatible MDP in 2035 and gone slightly below the threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The UK’s 2035 target is in the right ballpark for a cost-effective path to 1.5ºC. There’s also good detail on the current policy mix being implemented to cut emissions. We have the destination, and we have the tools to get there. What we now need is a detailed roadmap, breaking down sector by sector what the UK’s targets will be to achieve these emissions reductions. An updated net zero strategy will be published in “due course”, with full detail of policy packages across all sectors. The CAT is ready and waiting to evaluate this when it emerges.

The submitted NDC of 153 MtCO2e in 2035 is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is slightly below the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 167 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF, however, the UK's its 2030 target of 253 MtCO2e is still slightly above the 236 MtCO2e threshold for 1.5°C MDP excluding LULUCF.

The 2035 NDC target includes detail on the actions being taken in different sectors to reduce emissions. This includes a commitment to end new oil and gas licensing, to achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030, and to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles via the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy. These plans align with the UK’s commitments under the Global Stocktake (GST).

The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with the CAT’s own power sector benchmarks, which found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

Further information on the UK’s net zero target can be found here.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs that are at least aligned with globally cost-effective 1.5ºC pathways, and should communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The UK’s submitted 2035 NDC is 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.

Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. The UK has communicated that it intends to honour the commitment made by the previous government to spend GBP 11.6bn between 2021 and 2026, with at least GBP 3bn of this going to nature. This will be challenging, due to the systemic underspending on climate finance between 2021–2024, but is a welcome confirmation.

The UK then needs to commit to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026, as its 2030 and 2035 NDCs do not align with its fair share of global mitigation, and its provision of finance is currently rated as “Highly Insufficient."


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the huge emissions gap between current policies and a 1.5°C pathway. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The UK’s NDC fits within its institutional framework for planning, delivering and monitoring emission reductions. As such, it is a broadly credible document which demonstrates how planning and monitoring can help deliver on the commitments made.

However, planning and monitoring can only get you so far. Ultimately what is needed is action, and fast. The UK government inherited a vast implementation gap from the previous administration, with only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to meet the UK’s NDC covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024). While the Government has made steps in addressing this, much more will need to be done.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The UK has often been a leader in the transparency of its communications to the UNFCCC. While this NDC provides a large amount of detail, the UK has missed the opportunity to provide clarity in three key areas: LULUCF, carbon removal, and carbon credits. The UK’s LULUCF emissions are very small compared to total emissions (at less than 1% of total emissions in 2022), and so the lack of clarity on LULUCF is perhaps less of an issue.

However, the UK has been criticised for relying too heavily on carbon dioxide removal in its long-term strategy and net-zero targets. In this context, clarity on how much CO2 removal the government is banking on for its 2035 NDC would have been helpful. A clear commitment to not rely on carbon credits would also have been welcome, even if the UK has already stated that it “does not intend” to use them.

# Policies & action

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

We rate the UK’s current policies until 2030 as “Insufficient”, when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The new government needs to take rapid action to develop and implement climate policies to reduce emissions. Our 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway is based on global least-cost mitigation and defines the minimum level of emissions reductions needed at home to be 1.5°C compatible. It should be taken as the floor, and not ceiling, for domestic ambition.

The UK’s stalled progress in climate policy development over recent years means that, without immediate and rapid change, the UK can no longer be considered a leader in global climate action. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The new government has strongly indicated that it intends to address this policy shortfall, introducing new funding and delivery mechanisms to close the gap. The CAT will be tracking these policy developments and provide an updated assessment of the progress made in 2025.

Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.


## Policy overview

The new government has inherited a challenging policy context. The final years of the previous government were marked by chronic delays to key delivery mechanisms, rollbacks to other essential climate polices, and a clear lack of commitment to reducing emissions at the pace and scale needed to align with the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. As a result, in July 2024, only 24–32% of the emissions cuts needed to reach the UK’s climate targets were covered by credible policy (CCC, 2024).

The new government has highlighted that it wants to address this situation and close the implementation gap. It has already made a start on this, with some hopeful first signs including:

- In the power sector, where the government has set a target to achieve clean power by 2030. A decarbonised power sector by 2030 is a herculean endeavour, but would help unlock emissions cuts in other sectors, as clean electricity powers buildings, transport and industry. It would also demonstrate the viability of a clean power sector and rapid transition at scale, which could catalyse increased ambition in other countries and enable the UK to act as a global leader on power sector decarbonisation. To support this goal, the government has already lifted the de facto ban on onshore wind (DESNZ, 2024c) and secured record renewables capacity in the first auction after expanding the budget for renewables (DESNZ, 2024a, 2024d).
- In the buildings sector, the government has committed to double funding for energy efficiency improvements (Seddon, 2024), has signalled a willingness to enforce minimum efficiency standards in rental properties (DESNZ, 2024b) (a policy that was removed by the previous government), and has announced guidance on the next tranche of funding for retrofitting.
However, this will not be enough to close the implementation gap. Much more will be needed, including:

- **Ramping up renewables.** The government’s commitment to clean power needs to be backed by a laser-focus on delivery. The latest renewable auction delivered record levels of renewables, including 5 GW of offshore wind. But this is still not enough to achieve clean power by 2030 – more needs to be done. Grids and storage will also be key to the power sector transition.
- **Accelerating electrification.** Removing policy costs from electricity bills would help incentivise industrial electrification and ensure that heat pumps truly cut consumer bills. Specific policies to incentive industrial electrification are also needed, and planning barriers to heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points need to be removed.
- **Reversing recent rollbacks**. The previous government exempted 20% of houses from the fossil-fuelled boiler ban, and delayed the ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales to 2035. These policy rollbacks should be reversed.

## Power sector

Power in the UK is transforming rapidly. Having successfully completed the coal phase-out, the UK now stands before a challenge facing many governments worldwide: fossil gas and oil sources are decreasing while renewable deployments continue, but both are happening too slowly. To ensure the UK meets its international commitments and limit warming to 1.5ºC, the government must accelerate its efforts to decarbonise the power sector.

The UK’s power sector crossed a milestone in October 2024 when the last coal-fired power station shut down. Rapid growth in renewables has phased out coal without increasing demand for fossil gas generation. In 2023, almost half of the UK’s electricity came from renewables, with a third of generation from wind and solar alone.

The focus must now turn to phasing out fossil gas. The UK has a target of achieving clean power by 2030 – this is a laudable goal which would put the UK at the forefront of the global power sector transition and demonstrate the viability of a fully decarbonised power sector to all.


### Coal

On the use of coal in the power sector, we evaluate the UK as “**Coal free**.” After many years of effort, the UK has been able to fully eliminate the use of coal in electricity generation, an important step on the way towards a fully decarbonised power sector.

The UK’s last coal-fired power station closed in October 2024, marking the end of an era. This historic moment puts the UK as a front-runner in the transition away from coal in the power sector, phasing out coal six years ahead of the 2030 deadline for developed countries (Climate Action Tracker, 2023).

The UK’s coal exit is one of its main climate policy success stories of the past decade. As recently as 2012, coal provided 40% of the UK electricity mix (Ember, 2023). The rapid phase-out of coal means that power sector emissions fell on average by 10% each year between 2012–2022 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023).


### Fossil gas and oil

On the use of fossil gas and oil in the power sector, we evaluate the UK as sending “**Mixed signals.**” While both the share of energy produced by fossil gas and oil sources and their contributions to the total power supply have fallen over the last five years, gas remains a significant source of the UK’s electricity, providing nearly 30% in 2024. Plans to move away from fossil gas must be accelerated, and the UK must take care not to view fossil gas as an acceptable proxy for truly clean energy.

The new UK government has a target to achieve “clean power” by 2030. While it has not provided the exact definition of clean power, this ultimately must involve phasing out fossil gas in the power sector. The CAT has found that, to align with the Paris Agreement, the UK would need to reduce gas to 2–4% of the electricity mix by 2030 and cut this further by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s target for clean power appears broadly compatible with these benchmarks. Detailed modelling has shown that it is possible to push fossil gas out of the electricity system (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

It is unlikely that the UK will be able to fully phase out fossil gas in the electricity mix by 2030. However, it is possible to substantially cut gas demand. Detailed modelling highlights that the share of gas in the electricity system could fall to below 2% by 2030 without compromising security of supply (Ember, 2022). Keeping some of the fossil gas fleet as a “cold reserve” to provide very limited generation in periods of low renewable supply could help maintain energy security in the UK, while having a minimal impact on emissions. This fossil gas could then be fully phased out as alternative options to provide this back-up generation are deployed.

There is a wide range of options that can help balance a clean grid, including batteries, hydrogen, pumped storage, interconnectors and demand-side management. As such, fossil gas with CCS should play, at most, a minimal role in the power sector. Detailed modelling suggests that the UK could meet future electricity demand reliably in a grid dominated by wind and solar, with as little as 2.6 GW of fossil gas with CCS in the power sector in 2030, and only 0–5 GW by 2035 (CCC, 2023b; Ember, 2022).

Current CCS projects under development would be sufficient to reach this level. The UK should avoid embarking on a path of heavy reliance on fossil gas with CCS in the power sector, focussing instead on other measures to provide reliable zero-carbon electricity. Deploying turbines which can run on green hydrogen would be a key way to provide long-term flexible electricity generation without relying on CCS.


### Renewables

On the use of renewables in the power sector, we evaluate the UK as making “**Slow progress**.” For wind and solar sources, both their share of the energy mix and contributions to the total power supply have increased moderately over the last five years. While this is a positive trend, it needs to dramatically accelerate in order to keep the UK on a 1.5C compatible path to full decarbonisation.

The UK government is aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity by 2030 to support its goal of clean power by 2030 (Parkinson, 2024). Turbocharging renewables will be crucial to aligning with 1.5ºC, with the CAT finding that in the UK, the share of renewables in the power sector should reach 84–93% by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The UK’s goal of clean power by 2030 would align with this, depending on the exact assumptions made about the role of nuclear power in the electricity system.

Getting sufficient renewables capacity connected to the grid and generating before 2030 will be a herculean challenge. The UK has a range of policies to support renewables deployment. The central policy is the Contract for Difference (CfD) scheme, which offers a guaranteed price to renewable generators over their lifetime, with the price set by reverse auctions. This has encouraged competition and innovation in the sector and driven large-scale investment and deployment. Wind capacity more than doubled in the past decade to 30 GW in 2023, while solar capacity grew from 3 GW in 2013 to 16 GW in 2022 (Ember, 2023).

However, as of July 2024, there were around 30 GW of offshore wind either in operation or in active development of some form (Ember, 2024). Given the lead time for offshore wind projects, this would mean that the 2024/2025 auctions would need to achieve over 20 GW of offshore wind deployment to keep the power sector on track for the 2030 goals (Ember, 2024). The 2024 auction achieved only 5 GW, putting offshore wind deployment in the UK significantly off track for the governments’ aims, and making the 2025 auction a critical policy milestone. Onshore wind and solar PV installation rates are also off track. The new government will need to move fast to try and address these issues and get renewables deployed at the pace and scale needed for its 100% clean power goal.


## Industry

The UK’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy introduced by the previous government (UK Government, 2021a) aims to reduce industrial emissions by two-thirds below 2018 levels in 2035 and 90% by 2050. While emissions fell 3% in 2022 to 63 MtCO2e, they will need to fall much faster, by around 8% per year, to achieve the government’s climate targets (CCC, 2023a).

The strategy has a three-pronged approach: switching to low carbon fuels, efficiency gains, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). While some action is beginning to occur on fuel-switching, in particular in the electrification of steel, there remain significant gaps in the policies supporting resource efficiency in the industrial sector (CCC, 2024).

**Fuel switching**

In 2023, over 50% of industrial final energy was provided directly by fossil fuels (DESNZ, 2024c). This will need to be reduced substantially on the path to net zero. Two key options are the use of hydrogen, and direct electrification.

The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy sets a target of 50 TWh of fossil fuels to be replaced by low-carbon alternatives by 2035 in the manufacturing sector (UK Government, 2021a). This is roughly a third of industrial fossil consumption in 2022. To support this target, the previous government introduced the Industrial Decarbonisation and Hydrogen Revenue Support (IDHRS) scheme.

This is similar to the CfD scheme in the power sector, providing financial support to cover the additional cost of low-carbon hydrogen production. GBP 140m was allocated to support fuel-switching over 2023–2024. This provides a business model to support industrial fuel-switching to hydrogen and is a positive step. There is also a GBP 240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (DESNZ, 2023). While these funds are to be welcomed, they are much smaller than the scale of funds being offered in Europe to support hydrogen deployment (Abnett, 2023).

Industrial electrification has taken a step forwards in the UK, with the agreement of a deal to transform the Tata steelworks from a coal-fired blast furnace to an electric arc furnace producing recycled steel (H. Thomas & Browne, 2024). In November 2023, a similar decision was announced for the remaining blast furnaces operated by British Steel, although the planned switch date of 2025 may be set back due to grid connection delays (Gill, 2024). This marks a transition away from coal in steelmaking which will reduce emissions.

However, there has not yet been sufficient planning on how to ensure a just transition which preserves jobs in local communities dependent on steelmaking. This is a critical gap that must be addressed. There is also a need to drive industrial electrification in a more systematic way, with electricity prices still too high when compared to fossil gas (CCC, 2024).

**Carbon capture and storage**

The previous government set an aim of delivering 6 MtCO2/yr of industrial CCS by 2030, and 9 MtCO2/yr by 2035. This represents around 17% of total abatement in the industrial sector by 2035 (CCC, 2023a). The new government has continued this commitment to CCS, pledging GBP 22 bn of funding to drive CCS projects over the next 25 years (UK Government, 2024). Relying too heavily on CCS to deliver emissions reductions in the industrial sector could be risky, as the majority of previous CCS projects have ended in failure (Abdulla et al., 2020). In many sectors, the role and value of CCS is also being eroded as the cost of renewables declines (Grant, Hawkes, Napp, et al., 2021). CCS should be prioritised for applications where there are few alternatives, such as cement production (E3G, 2023).

**Fossil fuel supply**

Achieving the UK’s climate targets will require strong and sustained reductions in oil and gas production, as well as improvements to the emissions intensity of any remaining extraction. Oil and gas demand will need to fall around 30% by 2030 to achieve the UK’s NDC (CCC, 2020). The CCC also suggested that the emissions associated with oil and gas extraction should fall 68% by 2030, through electrification of processes and addressing fugitive emissions (CCC, 2020).

The previous UK government moved in the opposite direction, continuing to support new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea, approving the Abigail, Jackdaw and Talbot fields (Oil and Gas Authority, 2023; A. Thomas, 2022; Tidman, 2022). New licensing rounds were held annually (UK Government, 2023a).

The incoming government has set a new direction, committing to end licensing for new oil and gas fields (Lempriere, 2024). This is a good start and should be welcomed. However, it does not address the substantial pipeline of projects which have already received exploration licenses and are either waiting for development consent or are already in production. There are thirteen such projects awaiting approval (Dunne, 2024).

The new government could strengthen its position on oil and gas by publicly committing to not approve this remaining pipeline of projects, and also set out a clear path to phasing out oil and gas production in the UK in line with the Paris Agreement goals, for example joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA).


## Transport

The transport sector is the largest source of emissions in the UK, representing 29% of emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Central to decarbonising transport is ending the sale of fossil fuel cars and vans by 2030 and fossil fuelled heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) by 2035–40 (Department for Transport, 2021).

The policy context that the new UK government has inherited is mixed. On the one hand, the previous government confirmed the zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2023, which sets minimum EV sales targets for each vehicle manufacturer and will be a key delivery mechanism in scaling up EV sales (UK Government, 2023b). At the same time, the government pushed back the date of the sales ban on internal combustion engine cars from 2030 to 2035, sending a very mixed signal to the public and automotive industry. In 2023, the share of electric car sales in the UK failed to grow, flatlining at 16.5% and falling off track for the UK’s transition for the first time (SMMT, 2024). The share of electric van sales is growing much more slowly and is significantly off-track (CCC, 2024).

Key actions for the new government should include:

- **Reinstating the 2030 ban on petrol and diesel vehicle sales**
- **Taking action to help accelerate EV rollout**. This should include removing barriers for the installation of EV chargers and working with major van fleet operators to understand barriers to EV uptake.
**Aviation**

In 2022, the UK released its Jet Zero Strategy which aims to reduce emissions from this sector to net zero (Department for Transport, 2022). This aims for domestic aviation to reach net zero emissions by 2040, and total aviation emissions to reach net zero by 2050.

However, in this context, net zero does not mean eliminating the negative climate impacts of aviation, but rather allowing for a large-scale growth in emissions that would be compensated for via the UK emissions trading scheme, CORSIA and other offsetting mechanisms outside the aviation sector. The strategy also ignores the non-CO2 impact of aviation, which represents up to two-thirds of the sector’s overall climate impact (Lee et al., 2021).

The UK’s current strategy relies heavily on speculative technological innovation and carbon dioxide removal to enable a ‘net zero’ aviation sector, without addressing the elephant in the room – demand.

The previous government committed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would provide 10% of overall fuel use by 2030, rising to 22% by 2040 (UK Department for Transport, 2024). This is five times the level included in the CCC’s Balanced Net Zero Pathway and would require an unprecedented scale-up of SAF production. The new government confirmed this commitment, and introduced a SAF mandate to drive this uptake (Department for Transport, 2024). There will also be a revenue certainty mechanism to provide confidence to investors seeking to build SAF plants to meet UK demand. However, SAF deployment remains very low globally and has consistently failed to meet expectations (Rutherford, 2022). Relying so heavily on this option therefore represents a major delivery risk.

The Jet Zero strategy also fails to address demand. The Government states that “the sector can achieve Jet Zero without the government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth” (Department for Transport, 2022), and envisages that passenger numbers could rise 70% from 2021 to 2050. This is in contrast to the CCC’s advice, which was that no net expansion in airport capacity should be permitted, and passenger growth should be 25% at most (CCC, 2020). Numerous airports are currently planning expansions or have received approval to expand in the past two years (AEF, 2022) which again could threaten the UK’s ability to achieve its climate targets. As yet, the new government has not provided any clear commitments that it will curb aviation demand, with the chancellor repeatedly mentioning aviation as a key engine of economic growth (Topham, 2024).

As a result, in 2050, the Jet Zero strategy expects that aviation will still be emitting around 19 MtCO2 per year, which will need to be compensated for by CO2 removal. Given the very limited potential for CO2 removal and uncertainties in the climate system, CO2 removal should be reserved to hedge against climate uncertainties and balance out truly hard-to-abate residual emissions (e.g. from agriculture), rather than to facilitate a stark increase in aviation emissions in one of the world’s wealthiest countries.

For more information on the need to align aviation and shipping emissions with the Paris Agreement, see the sectoral pages oninternational aviation and international shipping.


## Buildings

Buildings were responsible for 20% of UK emissions in 2023 (DESNZ, 2024b). Emissions fell strongly in 2023 by 7.2% relative to 2022, due to reductions in gas demand (CCC, 2024). However, it remains unclear whether this was due to gas prices (which remain above the levels seen before the fossil gas energy crisis) or due to other drivers. Importantly, key indicators for tracking buildings decarbonisation, including the rate of heat pump installations and the rate of energy efficiency installations, are lagging far behind the level needed.

The number of heat pumps installed in 2023 increased only 4% from 2022 (CCC, 2024). The growth rate should be nearer 40–50% per year, if the number of annual installations is to reach 600,000–900,000 by 2030. Meanwhile the number of energy efficiency installations driven by government schemes fell in 2023, moving significantly off-track. This suggests that, without government action, the emissions reductions seen in 2023 will not be sustained into the future.

Priority actions for the new government should include:

- **Introducing a comprehensive programme for decarbonising public sector buildings**. Public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings represent a low-hanging fruit which could deliver substantial emissions reductions quickly.
- **Removing planning barriers to heat pumps**. The previous Government proposed such changes which would make it easier to install heat pumps (DLUHC, 2024). The new government should implement these changes immediately.
- **Re-introducing obligations for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of rented homes.** The new government has committed to do this in its manifesto – it must now turn this ambition into action.
- **Removing the exemption of 20% of houses from the fossil-fuel boiler installation phase-out**. The previous government introduced this exemption, suggesting that it would save money. However, maintaining the gas distribution network for such a small set of households would likely increase, not reduce costs.

## Agriculture

Agriculture was responsible for 12% of UK emissions in 2022 (DESNZ, 2024a). There has been essentially no progress made in agricultural decarbonisation over the past decade, with emissions in 2022 at the same level as in 2012.

In many places, the existing policy portfolio for agricultural decarbonisation is “too little, too late”. There is still no ban on the use of peat in gardening products, and plans to introduce methane-supressing feed products by 2030 are too late.

Key actions for the new government include:

- **Introducing policies to hedge against the risk of delivery failure**. The existing approach to agricultural decarbonisation has relied heavily on measures which are technological and voluntary in nature: this is a significant delivery risk. Productivity improvements on their own will not necessarily reduce emissions, with a risk that farmers simply increase herd numbers instead of freeing up land. Policies need to be developed to address these risks.
- **Introducing measures to** **address dietary change and food waste prevention**. The existing Government Food Strategy does not introduce measures to support and accelerate dietary shifts, despite the clear health benefits of doing so, and the evidence of consumer appetite for reduced meat consumption (Stewart et al., 2021; UK Government, 2022). The Food Strategy also only addressed food waste from large businesses, despite the majority of food waste occurring at the household, farm and supply-chain stages.
The UK has one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe, at 13% (Forest Research, 2023). The UK has set a target of planting 30,000 ha/yr of new woodland by 2025, which is aligned with the CCC’s recommendations. However, planting rates in 2023 were under half of this level (Forest Research, 2023).

It is essential that the new government takes action to accelerate tree planting. This will require new delivery mechanisms, complete with the required rates of funding. In particular, there is a need to provide clear long-term funding, and to streamline processes in order to draw in private capital.

Progress in protecting and restoring degraded peatland is also significantly off track. The Climate Change Committee recommends that over 60,000 ha/yr of peatland is restored from 2025 onwards. But in 2022/23, only 13,000 ha were restored – less than a fifth of recommended levels (CCC, 2023a). Key policy gaps include restrictions on the burning of peatland, as much peatland remains unprotected by current legislation, and a faster phase-out for peat in horticultural products, as the sale of peat will currently only be fully banned by 2030 (The Wildlife Trusts, 2023).


## Methane

14% of the UK’s total emissions in 2022 came from methane (DESNZ, 2024a), with 80% of these emissions coming from agriculture and waste. The UK is also a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge, which sets a target of reducing methane emissions by 30% over 2020–2030. However, to date methane emission reductions are not happening fast enough in the UK. On average, methane emissions fell 0.9 MtCO2e/yr over 2015–2022. This would need to double to over 1.9 Mt CO2e/yr to reach the current 2030 targets.

Key actions for the government to take include:

- **Publishing plans to capture methane emissions** from landfill sites, as well as improving the monitoring of landfill emissions.
- **Develop plans to reduce methane emissions from agriculture**. This should include accelerating the deployment of methane-supressing feed products within the industry, as well as promoting measures to cut demand for meat and dairy.
- **Track, monitor and transparently report** on the UK’s progress towards the Global Methane Pledge.

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions data for 1990–2021 were obtained from the UK Government (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023a). Provisional emissions data for 2022 was also included to extend the time series to 2021 (BEIS & DESNZ, 2023b). The UK provides inventory data to the UNFCCC that includes emissions from Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, which are not covered by UK climate policy and are not included in government emission projections. For this reason, we have chosen to use national emissions statistics rather than UNFCCC inventory emissions.


## NDC and other targets

The UK’s 2030 NDC target of at least a 68% reduction below 1990 levels is expressed using 100 year global warming potentials (GWP100) from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Government of the UK, 2022). In addition, the UK Government has specified that the target reference year includes F-gas emissions from 1995. Thus, to quantify the expected 2030 emissions, we apply the 68% reduction to a reference emissions level consisting of the UK’s emissions in 1990 but including F-gas from 1995 instead of 1990, all expressed in AR5 GWPs.

As the CAT presents all data across countries in GWP from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), the 2030 emissions implied by the NDC target in AR5 GWPs are then converted back into AR4 GWP. This is done by calculating a historical conversion factor from AR5 GWPs to AR4 GWPs, using historical data from 2021. This conversion factor can then be used to calculate the NDC in 2030 in AR4 GWPs.

The UK’s 2030 (NDC) and 2035 (Sixth Carbon Budget) emissions targets includes LULUCF emissions. This needs to be subtracted for comparability with other countries. We use projections from the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget to estimate LULUCF emissions in 2030 and 2035 (CCC, 2020). While the government’s approach to achieving the NDC and Sixth Carbon Budget differs somewhat from the CCC, there is strong alignment on afforestation pledges, and so LULUCF emissions will likely be closely aligned with the CCC’s projections, if these targets are to be met.

The UK’s 2035 emissions target additionally includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. These emissions were added to the 1990 baseline when calculating what a 78% reduction would entail. Projected 2035 emissions from international aviation and shipping were then removed from the implied 2035 target, as these emissions are captured under our IMO and ICAO assessments and would be double counted if they remained as part of the UK’s total emissions. Data is taken from the UK’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (DESNZ, 2023a).

The UK’s 2050 net-zero target also includes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, which need to be removed. In the absence of long-term projections from the UK Government, we use the Sixth Carbon Budget to calculate LULUCF and international shipping emissions in 2050, while the high ambition scenario from the recent Jet Zero strategy is used to estimate aviation emissions in 2050 (CCC, 2020; Department for Transport, 2022).


## Current policy projections

NOTE: Current policy projections for the UK have not been updated since the September 2023 CAT profile. A new current policy projection will be quantified in 2025.

To estimate current policy projections, we use the 2023 progress report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC, 2023a). In this report, the CCC estimates the impact of current UK policies on emissions. Policies are ranked as ‘credible’, displaying ‘some risks’ to delivery, displaying ‘significant risks’ to delivery, or ‘insufficient’.

To calculate the upper range of the current policies trajectory, we take the impact of all credible policies. These are policies where there are proven delivery mechanisms, a credible combination of public/private financing and clear timelines in place. The resulting emissions savings come predominantly from the zero-emissions vehicle mandate to drive EV sales and the renewable electricity supply policies in the power sector. To estimate the lower end of the current policy trajectory, we additionally include the impact of all policies ranked as displaying ‘some risks’. These include policies around home decarbonisation, industrial CCS, hydrogen, and also some policies in the transport and electricity supply sectors.

The CCC estimates that in 2030, there are credible policies to cut emissions by 42 MtCO2e, relative to the baseline. Policies with some risks to delivery could cut emissions by a further 51 MtCO2e in 2030. This gives an emissions level in 2030 (converting to AR4 GWPs and removing international aviation and shipping and LULUCF emissions, all of which are included in the CCC’s estimates) of 340–394 MtCO2e.

The conversion from AR5 to AR4 GWPs is done in the same way as when calculating the UK’s emissions targets, by calculating the ratio between AR5 and AR4 GWPs for 2021. Future LULUCF and international bunker emissions are taken from the UK’s Net Zero Strategy (UK Government, 2021b).

Note: Our data download includes projections until 2035; however, our graphics display the data until 2030 only.


## Net-zero target and other long-term targets

The UK has set a target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target includes international aviation and shipping (IAS) emissions, as well as LULUCF emissions and removals from BECCS/DACCS (UK Government, 2019d). The CAT assesses IAS and LULUCF separately, and therefore these need to be removed from the projections.

The UK Government does not provide detail on the LULUCF emissions they assume in 2050. In the absence of this, we take analysis from the CCC, which suggested that in the Balanced Net Zero pathway which reaches net zero by 2050, LULUCF emissions would be -19 MtCO2/yr (CCC, 2020). We also use this source to estimate future emissions from IAS. In the Balanced Net Zero pathway, emissions from aviation and shipping in 2050 are 24 MtCO2. Assuming an equal split between international and domestic aviation/shipping in 2050 as in 2019, this means that in 2050, IAS emissions would be 19 MtCO2/yr.

Under these assumptions, the UK’s net zero target remains a 0 MtCO2e target in 2050 once LULUCF and IAS have been removed. However, in reality, the UK Government intends residual emissions to fall to around 70-80 MtCO2e/yr, with engineered removals from BECCS/DACCS offsetting these remaining emissions.


## Global Warming Potentials

The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series.


# Targets


## Target Overview

In 2020, the UK updated its 2030 NDC to reduce GHG emissions by at least 68% below 1990 levels (including LULUCF and excluding international aviation and shipping). This is an increase on the previous target of a 57% reduction below 1990 levels. The UK also set a 2035 target to reduce emissions by 78% below 1990 levels including both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping. The CAT excludes both LULUCF and international aviation and shipping from its analysis. Converting to this basis, the UK’s targets are to reduce emissions by 68% and 82% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 2035 respectively.

In 2019, the UK increased the ambition of its 2050 target to net zero GHG emissions (UK Government, 2019d).

*The CAT focuses on future emissions excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping (international bunker) emissions. The UK’s net zero target covers both LULUCF and international bunkers. The CCC’s path for reaching net zero by 2050 involves residual emissions of ~19 MtCO2e from international bunkers, and also a 19 MtCO2e sink from the LULUCF sector. These offset one another so that 2050 emissions remain at 0 MtCO2e. However, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions, with residual emissions from aviation and other sectors balanced by removals from LULUCF and engineered CO2 removal.


## NDC updates

**2030 NDC targets**

On 12 December 2020, the UK submitted its first updated NDC to the UNFCCC after leaving the European Union. This NDC commits the UK to reducing GHG emissions to 68% below 1990 levels by 2030. This represents a significant strengthening from the UK’s previous 2030 commitment, which was to reduce emissions by 57% below 1990 levels. The UK’s NDC is now aligned with its 2050 target of achieving net zero GHG emissions, according to analysis by the CCC (CCC, 2020).

The UK’s NDC is not fully aligned with 1.5°C when compared to global least-cost modelled domestic pathways. This represents a downgrade from previous CAT analyses (from 2022 and earlier), due to the use of more recent global pathways aligned with 1.5ºC. A further strengthening of the UK’s NDC is therefore necessary to align with the latest evidence coming from least-cost modelled 1.5°C compatible domestic pathways. Strengthening the UK’s NDC would also better enable the UK to embody the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities that are central to the Paris Agreement.

Analysis has shown that an emissions reductions target of up to 70% (CCC, 2020) and towards 75% would be achievable (WWF, 2020). However, each day of delay makes achieving deep emission reductions much more challenging.

The UK revisited and updated its NDC on 23 September 2022 (Government of the UK, 2022). The UK did not strengthen the overall GHG emissions reductions target, as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 under the UK’s presidency. It did, however, provide a range of additional information to increase clarity, transparency and understanding.

This includes information on how the UK will deliver its NDC by 2030, how it will assess the NDC’s achievement, an update on the NDC’s territorial scope (which includes the Crown Territory of Jersey and Overseas Dependency of Gibraltar), and more information on how the UK’s climate targets relate to broader goals around gender, green skills, a just transition, biodiversity, health, air pollution and public engagement.

However, without strengthening the level of ambition in its NDC and providing increased levels of climate finance to support emissions reductions in less wealthy countries, the UK will be unable to improve its rating on the Climate Action Tracker.

* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.

## CAT rating of targets

NOTE: This update does not conduct a new rating of the UK’s climate targets, as the new government only entered power in July 2024. Instead, it describes the context inherited by the new government and highlights key areas for improvement. We will respond to any major announcements and provide an updated rating for the UK in 2025.

The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The UK does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

When compared against least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C, the UK’s target is rated as "Almost Sufficient". The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s domestic target in 2030 is not yet consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements.

If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.

This is a downgrade of the UK’s NDC compared to the CAT's 2022 UK assessment, where we rated the UK’s target as 1.5ºC compatible. This is because the CAT is now producing modelled domestic pathways via the latest global scenarios assessed by the IPCC’s AR6 report, rather than the older scenarios from the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5ºC.

The lack of progress in global emissions reductions in recent years is increasing the pressure on the emissions cuts needed by 2030. As a result, under the latest pathways, the UK’s emissions need to fall faster to align with 1.5ºC, and the UK’s NDC (which was previously only just aligned with 1.5ºC) has now been downgraded to "Almost Sufficient". This highlights the importance of aligning with 1.5ºC in the most robust manner possible.

NDC target against fair share

The CAT’s assessment of the UK’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

When compared against what would be a fair share of effort towards achieving the Paris Agreement goals, the UK’s NDC is rated as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the UK’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C.

The UK’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow the UK’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The UK’s current NDC sets a target of 253 MtCO2e/yr in 2030 (when expressed in AR4 GWPs excl. LULUCF). To improve its fair share rating, the UK would need to cut emissions by an additional 280–400 MtCO2e, to reach negative GHG emissions by 2030. Some of these additional reductions can be achieved domestically, by cutting UK emissions to more than 68% below 1990 levels (WWF, 2020). Where possible, the UK should seek to increase the ambition of its 2030 target to 70% and beyond.

Where further emissions reductions are not possible, the UK would need to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. Without this, the UK cannot be seen to be aligned with the Paris Agreement’s commitment to reflect ‘equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities’ in climate action.

The UK’s reported contributions to financing emission reductions abroad fall far short of its fair share (Gabbatiss, 2023) contribution to the USD 100 bn goal which itself needs to be increased substantially to help drive the global energy transition (Pachauri et al., 2022). On this (most important) metric, the UK is therefore rated as “Highly Insufficient”.

In 2019, the UK committed to doubling its climate finance provision from GBP 5.8 bn (USD 7.6 bn) across 2016–2020 to GBP 11.6 bn (USD 15.1 bn) across 2021–2026 (UK Government, 2019), which earns it an “Almost sufficient” rating for future commitments. However, in July 2021 it was revealed that this would not be new funding, and instead would be taken from the existing aid budget (Merrick, 2021). This is in contradiction with a UN-brokered agreement that such funding would be ‘new and additional’ (UNFCCC, 2011).

The UK has also consistently underspent climate finance over 2021–2023 (Rowlatt, 2023), and UK total climate finance provision fell from 2020/21 to 2022/23 (Gabbatiss, 2023). The previous government attempted to meet its target partly by further reclassifying existing aid spending as climate finance (FCDO, 2023). Such an approach is deeply regrettable.

The new UK government should aim to reclaim leadership in the area of climate finance by:

- Committing to reaching the GBP 11.6 bn goal across 2021–2026
- Resetting the rules on what constitutes climate finance to put the UK at the front of the pack in terms of tracking climate finance (rather than in the middle with other donors)
- Committing to an ambitious climate finance goal for post-2026
**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Net zero and other long-term target(s)

We evaluate the net zero target as: “**Acceptable**”.

The UK has enshrined the net zero target by 2050 in law by revising and amending the Climate Change Act 2008 in 2019. The Net Zero Strategy released in October 2021 has been submitted to the UNFCCC as the UK’s updated long-term strategy.

The net zero target covers most key elements considered important by the CAT to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. The UK meets good practice for most of these benchmarks, but some elements remain undefined or lacking. For example, a clear commitment not to use reductions or removals outside of the UK, and providing separate targets for emissions reductions and removals would improve the target architecture of the UK’s net zero target.

The UK was the first major economy to establish and pass a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019 (UK Government, 2019d). The UK’s target covers all sectors and gases and includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. Excluding LULUCF and international aviation and shipping, this corresponds to 2050 emissions of 0 MtCO2e/yr as existing residual emissions from agriculture and other sectors such as international aviation are being balanced by CO2 removal from BECCS, DACCS and other approaches. For this reason, this does not represent a target to reach absolute zero emissions. **For the full analysis click** here**.**
