# Summary


## Overview

**Under the Biden Administration, the US has seen promising signs of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is mobilising historic levels of investment in clean energy solutions and activating subnational and non-state action on climate change. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recently revised regulations in the power and transport sectors further enhance the government’s climate policy package.**

**Although the country has made progress under the Biden Administration, the US will still be far from meeting its domestic climate target—let alone aligning its emissions with a 1.5°C trajectory—without additional, drastic emissions reductions measures. To meet its domestic target, the US would need to bolster its policy packages at the sectoral level to address the rising demand for electricity across sectors.**

**The government would also need to reverse the trend of increasing fossil fuel extraction.** **CAT analysis**** in 2022 shows the US is also moving in the wrong direction regarding its international support for fossil fuels. Overall, the CAT rates the US climate targets, action, and climate finance at the end of the Biden Administration as “Insufficient”. An assessment of the impact of the Trump Administration will follow once information is available.**

On 5 November 2024, former President Donald Trump won the US election, and will take office on 20 January 2025. The US will continue to face the challenges in meeting its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and achieving future climate goals aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. Reaching these targets will require the implementation of additional policies, which may prove challenging under the Trump Administration. However, opportunities remain for climate action at the state and municipality level and for furthering the progress made under the IRA.

As of 2022, the US has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target. CAT current policies projections, which include the IRA, show a more pronounced reduction in emissions until 2030 compared to historic reductions. Although CAT projections suggest the US will close the gap by an additional 30%–44% by 2030, it is still 23%–37% short of meeting its 2030 emissions reduction target; evidence that further action is critically necessary. The current US target of 50–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 is not 1.5˚C compatible.

**Although there have been positive developments under the IRA, oil and gas production** **has increased under the Biden Administration.** The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record-level production in 2023. The country is also the worlds' largest fossil gas producer and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter for liquified natural gas (LNG). In 2022, fossil fuels also received the largest subsidies from the government since 2010. In early 2024, the Biden Administration placed a temporary moratorium on pending LNG export terminals. However, the administration continues to approve large-scale fossil fuel projects.

**The IRA has had its most positive impact on the power sector**. The government’s decarbonisation target for the power sector aligns with the CAT’s Paris Agreement-compatible benchmarks, as well as with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero strategy: by 2035, the US aims to achieve net zero emissions in the sector. The IRA has stimulated large investment in technologies critical for decarbonising the power sector, but barriers remain; especially since the demand for electricity is expected to grow significantly. Important areas for the power sector's transition, such as the electricity grid, have been significantly underfunded. The anticipated coal phase-out, as out outlined in the recently revised EPA standards, will be too late to be Paris Agreement compatible, and fossil gas-fired plants are largely exempt from the standards.

**In the transport sector, the IRA has particularly supported the manufacturing and uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), while the EPA has enhanced the regulatory framework for EVs by revising its emissions standards until 2032.** The government aims to decarbonise the sector by 2050. However, this timeline is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The IRA has spurred significant investment in the domestic EV value chain, especially in battery manufacturing, and the deployment of HDVs in commercial and public fleets. The act also expands subsidies for EV purchases and unlocks new funding for public transport.

**A major ambition gap continues to exist in the industry sector, where the government has set a decarbonisation objective but has not specified a clear timeline for reaching the objective.** The IRA provides a patchwork of instruments to support technologies to decarbonise the industry sector. The IRA unlocks billions in funding for industrial technologies in their research and development phase, while introducing and expanding tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage deployment, renewable energy and critical material projects, and clean hydrogen production. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM) continues to phase down F-gases significantly.

**The government’s emissions reductions targets for the buildings sector are not aligned with the Paris Agreement.** Due to limited federal measures to regulate building energy use and emissions, the decarbonisation of the sector will likely heavily rely on electrification. Without further efforts to reduce building envelope energy use and emissions, this dependency will put increasing pressure on the power sector and its decarbonisation.

**The agriculture sector lacks a clear decarbonisation objective and, while the IRA allocates funding to boost conservation programmes, the act’s measures do not seem to meaningfully reduce sectoral emissions and even include funding for livestock production.** The US has neither developed or implemented any regulations to address emissions from animal production, nor has it meaningfully encouraged dietary change. Such demand-side changes could result in large mitigation impacts in the US, which has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world.

**Net forest sinks are threatened by land conversion, increasing demand for timber products, and more frequent natural disturbances from climate change.** The IRA increased funding for the National Forest Service and other programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities, but logging efforts are nevertheless set to increase.

**Aside from strengthening its sectoral policies and targets and reducing fossil fuel exploitation and exportation, the US should address gaps in its international climate contributions:**

- **Increase international climate finance contributions and cease funding fossil fuels abroad.** The Biden Administration is still far from reaching its pledge of USD 11.4bn/year. In FY2023, only USD 1bn was appropriated for climate finance by the US Congress. The US also broke its commitment to stop financing fossil fuels abroad when the American Export-Import Bank (EXIM) lent USD 100m to Indonesia to expand an oil refinery in May 2023.
- **Increase the ambition of its NDC.** The US has not yet updated its climate target despite the commitment to do so by countries at COP26 in 2021. For the US climate target to be compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory, the country must reduce its emissions by at least 62%–65% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF), while providing more financial support to other countries.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the combination of the US 2030 climate targets, policies, and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the totality of the government’s policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The US 2030 domestic emissions reduction target (NDC) is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways, but not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. US policies and action lead to falling emissions in 2030, but not by enough to meet either its targets or the 1.5°C limit.

The US does not meet its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its domestic targets and policies, needs to provide and mobilise further support to developing countries.

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its mitigation targets. The CAT projects US GHG emissions in 2030 to be 29%–39% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), falling short of its 2030 NDC target (44%–49% excl. LULUCF), and significantly short of its fair share target.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. Although the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry, it is the most ambitious climate policy package in US history and brings the country closer to meeting its 2030 target.

Although the IRA is a major step towards achieving the US NDC, the government still needs to introduce additional policies and action to achieve its domestic emissions reduction target. EPA standards in the power and transport sector passed in 2024 are important complementary instruments. However, more ambitious (sectoral) climate policies at the federal and state levels are still needed to reach the US targets. The increasing trend in oil and gas production also needs to be reversed.

The projected emissions trajectory range in this update is wider than in the previous update, due to the inclusion of a broader set of models to estimate the IRA's impact. The range of policy projections for the US falls into the “Insufficient” category but reaches the “Almost sufficient” category at its lower end.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the government’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvement to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**See full summary of** **policies and actions here****.**

We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US domestic target for 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the US target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The CAT’s assessment of the US’ total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the 2030 target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of further financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

We rate the United States’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on the government’s 2022 OECD contributions. The Biden Administration committed to increase its climate finance contributions but contributions until 2024 remain low compared to its fair share. In FY2024, only USD 1bn (approximately the same amount as in 2023) were appropriated for climate finance by Congress.

While the government claims larger sums have been made available (notably, USD 5.8 bn in 2022), these funds mainly relate to adaptation and/or are not principal financing. Only principal mitigation financing is accounted for in the CAT's rating. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and stop supporting fossil fuels abroad.

The US’ climate finance is not sufficient to improve the rating of its NDC against its fair share, and the CAT rates the US’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

We evaluate the US net zero target as: **Average.** The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), in which the US officially commits to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 latest.

The net zero target covers all GHG emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature- and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target, such as including international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly committing to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

The Biden Administration submitted the US long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), officially committing the US to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by land-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping to its target coverage, and explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets. The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The government further ought to explain how and why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

The foreseen use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the government’s plan is concerning given that CCS is not commercially viable due to its high additional costs and does not reduce the emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). Modelling exercises examining a net zero power sector by 2035 highlight that under a variety of scenarios considering different technology options, fossil CCS plays a diminishing or no role at all (Denholm et al., 2022). While the strategy acknowledges the uncertainties around carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, further emissions reductions efforts should be undertaken to reduce the significant amount of CDR required in the strategy: CDR should only be treated as a last-resort option.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The US government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Emissions coverage** – The US net zero target includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The US government deliberately excludes international aviation and shipping from its net zero target’s coverage (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The US government reserves its right to use international market mechanisms towards the achievement of this net zero goal (U.S. Department of State, 2021), even if it currently does not expect to do so.
- **Legal status** – The US government submitted its updated long-term strategy (LTS) including its net zero announcement to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The net zero target has not yet been enshrined in law as of November 2024.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The US government does not provide separate emissions reductions and removal targets. However, the US provides projections on its use of direct air capture (DAC) and LULUCF in its LTS.
- **Review process** – The LTS specifies that progress toward the net zero target will be regularly assessed without providing further specific information on the envisioned process. The government has indicated that it may update the LTS in the future, but has not committed to any legally-binding revision process.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The US government provides transparent assumptions and pathways on both natural sinks and technology-based CDR towards 2050 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Land‑based sinks reach roughly 600–1,400 MtCO2e in 2050, while technology-based CDR reaches roughly 300–500 MtCO2e in 2050. On the latter, no detailed information is provided on storage capacities for captured carbon emissions, nor the combination of technologies envisioned to increase this sink. As the CAT’s net zero evaluations across all countries highlight, this represents a higher reliance on CDR compared to the average of the other G20 countries that are member of the Climate Neutrality Coalition: on average G20 countries have 5% residual emissions in the target year whereas the US include 8%-23% residual emissions in 2050 as a share of 2019 emissions.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The updated LTS presents multiple pathways and a set of transparent assumptions to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The government has outlined multiple measures and actions across different sectors, most prominently to fully decarbonise domestic electricity supply by 2035 (assuming a substantial increase of electricity generation capacity using fossil fuels equipped with CCS in 2050).Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.
- The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The US government makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The Trump Administration’s move to exit the Paris Agreement will effectively annul the 2035 climate target submitted by the Biden Administration in late 2024. More importantly and more materially, the Trump Administration’s actions to dismantle policies and rescind funding for climate change mitigation means that limiting peak global warming to 1.5°C will be even more challenging and will require other countries to make more rapid and even deeper emissions reductions. The Trump Administration’s climate agenda is seriously risking a high, multi-decadal overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s long-term 1.5°C temperature limit, even if a future US administration strengthens its targets and actions.

The 2035 NDC submitted by the Biden Administration can still act as a guide for subnational and non-state entities to continue climate action in the US, even as the Trump Administration has initiated the process to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, it should be noted that the Biden era 2035 climate target is not 1.5˚C aligned. Therefore, subnational actors seeking to advance Paris-aligned action must go beyond this target and its measures.

The Biden Administration's NDC sets a 2035 target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 61–66% below 2005 levels. The target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT, which excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), finds that the target results in 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035. This target is not 1.5°C-compatible against modelled domestic pathways: a 1.5°C compatible emissions level, excluding LULUCF, would be 2,200 MtCO2e in 2035.

At the time the Biden Administration submitted the NDC, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were the central federal mechanisms for driving emission reductions towards the 2035 target. However, under the CAT's current policy projections—which consider the impact of the BIL and IRA and were developed before the Trump Administration took office—the US will not reduce emissions fast enough to reach the 2035 target.

To reach the Biden Administration’s target, the US government would have needed to implement new, additional climate policies and actions; an outlook that the Trump Administration has rendered unlikely, as it has already taken executive actions to repeal existing climate policies, including the BIL and IRA, limit federal funding for climate action, and expand fossil fuel production.

The Biden Administration worked in close collaboration and cooperation with subnational actors in state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments to develop the 2035 target. If the Trump Administration continues to obstruct and undo climate policies, subnational and non-state actors need to slow the impact of the federal rollback of climate policies by strengthening climate action at the subnational level.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The US’ submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The submitted NDC of 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, the US would need to reduce its emissions, excluding LULUCF, to 2,225 MtCO2e in 2035. The 2035 NDC does not increase the 2030 NDC target’s ambition.

The US 2035 economy-wide target does not include specific sectoral plans and targets. The NDC does outline the key federal policies in the power, buildings, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors that were expected to drive emissions reductions towards the 2035 target. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—both of which were developed by the Biden Administration and were introduced after the US 2030 NDC submission—are described as the principal national-level policies for achieving the 2035 target. The BIL aims to expedite the development and implementation of clean energy infrastructure. The IRA is intended to mobilise unprecedented public and private investment in clean energy production. In combination, the BIL and IRA were planned to incentivise and accelerate climate action across the US economy and, since their introduction, have already reduced emissions.

It is important to note that the future of both the BIL and IRA is uncertain. The Trump Administration has already taken executive action to freeze federal funding under both laws, and has signalled that it will try to roll back certain components. While the Trump Administration cannot use executive action to unilaterally repeal either the BIL or IRA, Republican majorities in the House and in Congress may be supportive of and carry out the administration’s agenda. As of October 2024, Republicans voted 53 times in the House and once in the Senate to repeal certain climate provisions in the IRA since its introduction in 2022.

The NDC explicitly draws attention to the US federal governance structure and highlights the importance and capacity of state and other subnational governments to contribute towards the 2035 target. State governments are especially well-positioned to reduce emissions in the power, transport, and buildings sectors. However, if the Trump Administration, with support from the Republican majority in both the House and Congress, permanently restricts funding or reverses regulations for the BIL and IRA’s implementation, it is unclear whether subnational entities would be able to make up the lack of federal funding and policies.

The 2035 NDC does not include a renewable energy capacity target. Instead, the document references the US power sector target of generating 100% “clean,” “carbon pollution-free" electricity by 2035. This target is not—and should not be—conflated with a renewable energy target. The target’s formulation allows the government to use fossil energy with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), as well as nuclear and biomass energy, to achieve the target. The NDC cites the current share of renewable energy generation, which has more than doubled over the past decade; in 2023, renewables generated 21% of the US electricity.

The NDC claims the 2035 target is fully aligned with its net zero pathway; it argues that “the entire 2035 range is on a straight line or steeper trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 for all greenhouse gases.” To achieve its net zero target, the CAT estimates the US needs to reduce emissions to 558–1,540 MtCO2e or 80-93% below 2005 levels in 2050, excluding LULUCF. Assuming the US realises its 2030 NDC target, the 2035 NDC target is aligned with the median net zero pathway, but not the pathway’s uppermost bound. Further information on the US net zero target can be found here.

The NDC explicitly refers to the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake. The NDC outlines targets, measures, and metrics that correspond with some of the Global Stocktake’s sectoral goals. Highlights include references to the US expansion of renewable energy generation, the rate of electrification and energy efficiency improvements, the adoption of zero- and low-emissions vehicles, and the commitment to halting and reversing deforestation by 2030. It is important to note that the US does not commit to phasing out either fossil gas or coal.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries.

In its 2035 NDC, the US does not acknowledge its responsibility, nor communicate its intention to provide and mobilise climate finance to other countries. The US did not do so in its 2030 NDC either. Developed countries, like the US, are expected to complement their domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The US submitted 2035 NDC is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reductions target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the still significant emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The US 2035 NDC details the planning processes behind the target’s development and the existing measures for its implementation. However, the CAT finds that the US would need to go beyond the Biden Administration’s policies and actions and enact new measures to reach the 2035 target. The Trump Administration has vowed to reverse the Biden Administration's course on climate action and has already taken executive action to undermine many of the policies that underpin the NDC. The administration’s initiation of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement essentially voids the NDC, and the administration's actions entirely compromise the target’s credibility.

The US needs to implement new, additional climate policies and actions to reach its 2035 target, as current policies are insufficient. The CAT estimates that existing policies will reduce emissions by 33–50% below 2005 levels in 2035, emitting 3,780–5,071 MtCO2e in 2035, well below a 1.5˚C compatible level of 2,225 MtCO2e.

The 2035 NDC’s development was coordinated and managed by the Biden Administration’s White House Climate Policy Office. Central to the target’s development was a bottom-up analysis of existing and possible policies at the national, subnational, and non-state level.

The revision was drafted in consultation and cooperation with a broad, diverse coalition of state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments, as well as workers unions, private sector representatives, civil society organisations, and higher education institutions. In doing so, the NDC acknowledges the important role of subnational and non-state climate action.

While the NDC highlights the importance of subnational and non-state climate action, it also identifies national-level policies that are key to the realisation of the 2035 target. The BIL and IRA are described as “the backbone of the suite of existing federal legislation and investments that are contributing to the achievement the 2035 NDC target.” However, the future of these policies is uncertain. The Trump Administration has signalled that it will try to eliminate components of the BIL and IRA and has also initiated processes to reverse emissions standards in the power and transport sectors; the standards that were strengthened under the Biden Administration and are cited in the NDC as important components for realising the 2035 target.

In its NDC, the US does not commit to discontinuing fossil fuel exploration, production, or subsidies. The US is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and fossil gas. Since 2022, the US is the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG). The US government continues to heavily subsidise fossil fuels: in 2023, fossil fuel subsidies totalled nearly USD 15bn. The US plans to expand oil and gas production and increase LNG exports. The US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) most recent projections of the US energy market forecast that fossil gas production will increase by 15% and LNG exports will increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest emitters in the world, the US has a responsibility to take ambitious action to phase out fossil fuels.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emissions reductions target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) to ensure they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The US 2035 NDC target is not based on an absolute value. Instead, the target is formulated as a percentage reduction below 2005 levels.

The NDC target covers all sectors, including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The NDC does not break down the economy-wide target by sector. As a result, it is unclear how each sector would contribute to meeting the target. The inclusion of the LULUCF sector’s emissions, which are uniquely challenging to account for, undermines the target’s transparency.

The target considers all greenhouse gas emissions, but does not set targets for specific greenhouse gases. However, the NDC anticipates a reduction of methane emissions of at least 35% below 2005 levels in 2035. The NDC also forecasts “significant emissions reductions from other non-carbon dioxide super pollutants.”

The 2035 NDC does not define a specific emissions pathway, claiming “the NDC is built on the premise that there are multiple pathways to achieving the expected level of emissions reductions.” The NDC does not provide any further clarification on the number of and differences between pathways.

In the NDC, the US does not transparently communicate the intended or expected contribution of the carbon dioxide removals (CDR) or carbon markets. The NDC leaves the door open for the use of contentious voluntary carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; the NDC notes, in the case that the US relies on carbon markets to achieve its target, the government would appropriately report the use of such market mechanisms.

# Policies & action

According to our analysis, the US will need to implement additional policies to reach its targets. We project GHG emissions will reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e in 2030 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF). This is equivalent to 29%–39% reduction from 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), which is insufficient to meet the NDC target (45%–50% excl. LULUCF).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, represents a significant milestone in US climate policy. While its full impact is still unfolding due to the nature of its 10-year implementation plan, the first years have shown real promise. The IRA is mobilising historic investments in clean energy, driving clean projects, creating jobs, and attracting private sector funding. EPA standards for the power and transport sectors, passed in 2024, provide two further milestones in important policy areas.

However, to achieve its domestic emissions reductions target—let alone to reach a 1.5°C-compatible emissions level—the government needs to complement its recent advancements with further sector-specific policies and a shift away from fossil fuels.

The projected emissions trajectory range is wider in this update than previously, due to the incorporation of new analyses that better highlight the uncertainties related to the IRA's implementation. While the middle of the policy projections' range falls into the “Insufficient” category, its lower end, representing a positive outlook on the government’s current policies, falls into the “Almost sufficient” range.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the US’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The Biden Administration has set the goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, which is consistent with a Paris Agreement pathway.

## Policy overview

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its 2030 and long-term targets. After an increase in GHG emissions between 2021 and 2022, emissions started to decline in 2023 (-1.9%) (Rhodium Group, 2024). The government has set a target to reduce emissions by 3.8–4.2 GtCO2e/year in 2030.

According to our projections, emissions are forecasted to decline at an average of 1.7%–3.9% per year and reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e/year by 2030 (29%–39% below 2005 levels; and 19%–31% below 1990), excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Under these projections, the US would achieve 64%–87% of its emissions reductions target in 2030, indicating a gap of 13%–36% that would need to be filled with new and additional climate policies and action. As it stands, the 2030 target is not 1.5˚C compatible. Reaching a level in line with a global least-cost pathway requires further reductions of 1.4–2.2 GtCO2e below the current policy pathway.

Compared to CAT projections in August 2023, our range of emission projections includes an updated estimate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) impact, as well as estimates of the impact of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2024 regulations for the power and transport sectors. As a result, the US emissions projections decreased relative to the CAT’s previous projections, while the range, based on existing policies, widened for 2030–2035. The upper bound decreased by 2% and the lower bound decreased by 8%. The reduced, widened range in emission projections highlights the continued effort by the US government to cut emissions, while recognising the high uncertainty of policy outcomes; especially for the government’s flagship climate policies, including the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

The IRA injects USD 370bn into the US economy over a 10-year period. This infusion takes the form of tax credits, grants, and loans intended to develop and deploy the clean energy technologies and investments that are essential for the economy's decarbonisation (The White House, 2023a).

Since the IRA's implementation in 2022, the country has witnessed a significant surge in public and private investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure: between August 2022 and February 2024, investment in announced clean energy projects and infrastructure totalled USD 352bn. Specific highlights include record investment in battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and in grid and transmission infrastructure (Climate Power, 2024c).

Due to these investments, the share of clean energy investments in total investments increased from 3.7% in Q4 of 2022 to 5% in Q4 in 2023, representing a significant uptick in the role that clean energy investments play in the US economy (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). Given the scale of public investment, some studies suggest that the IRA could spur USD 3tn in private investments over the coming decade (Goldman Sachs, 2023).

The BIL and IRA, alongside the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, have set the stage for record private investment in the construction of domestic manufacturing facilities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023b). Before the IRA and CHIPS Act were signed, annual investment in manufacturing construction remained below USD 150bn. Since the acts’ passage, investment surged to an all-time high of USD 223bn by February 2024 (FRED Economic data, 2024; Joint Economic Committee, 2024).

Investment in the EV supply chain, especially in battery cell manufacturing and critical mineral production, has increased significantly and accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clean manufacturing investments by the end of 2023 (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). As a result of this increase in investment, the US surpassed the EU in battery cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, even though the EU’s capacity was two times larger than the US’ capacity in 2021 (Delgado et al., 2024).

These investments contribute to job creation, with estimates showing that the IRA’s provisions have already generated over 270,000 clean energy jobs (Climate Power, 2024b). The act has also contributed to a more just energy transition by targeting disadvantaged communities and rural areas. Many of the announced investments specifically target and aim to contribute to the economic development of these regions and communities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023a).

In early 2024, the US expanded its climate policy portfolio through the addition of several EPA policies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i, 2024l). The EPA introduced several standards for gas and coal-fired power plants and updated its vehicle emissions standards. Even though these standards were watered down before their finalisation (see Electricity generation and Transport sections below), they add an important regulatory complement to the incentive-based IRA: by setting yearly emissions levels for technologies, the standards provide important guidance for the private sector.

To realise its 2030 and 2035 targets and to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5˚C temperature goal, the US has to implement further, more ambitious policies and measures. Additional measures could focus on those sectors in which ambitious action has yet to be taken, such as the building or agriculture sector.

At the same time, the government can further strengthen existing policies across all sectors; for example, the government could extend the IRA beyond 2030, introduce coal phase-out targets for 2030, and enhance energy efficiency standards (America Is All In, 2024). Manufacturing capacity could also be strengthened, in particular for wind turbine and heat pump production (IEA, 2024a). Given that the federal government’s jurisdiction is limited some policy areas, state governments can play a significant role.

Some states, such as Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota, have recently introduced climate policies that are more ambitious than at the federal level (Joselow & Montalbano, 2023). To advance climate action at the subnational level, state governments can adopt of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and introduce sales targets for EVs.

Despite the IRA’s remarkable measures to support clean energy and address climate change, the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The concessions are described in the Power section.


## Power

Electricity supply contributed to 25% of total US GHG emissions in 2022 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). Total annual emissions in the power sector have declined steadily since 2010, mainly driven by a shift from coal to lower or non-emitting generation sources, such as fossil gas and renewables.

Electricity production from renewables overtook production from coal and nuclear power for the first time in 2022, making renewables the country’s second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j). Preliminary figures for 2023 suggest that coal is now becoming the least relevant generation source in the US, when all types of renewables are counted together (Rhodium Group, 2024)

Following a drop in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions in the power sector returned to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovered, but began dropping again in 2023. In 2021, electricity generation and emissions from coal-fired power plants increased for the first time since 2014 by 16% and 15%, respectively (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). The marked increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, and its sustained elevated level in 2022, can be mainly attributed to the significantly higher and more volatile prices of fossil gas as a consequence of the 2021 energy crisis, which rendered coal more competitive (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021b, 2023n).

In 2023, gas generation rebounded and replaced coal generation, which led to emissions reductions in the sector. Although renewables contributed to sectoral emissions reductions, fossil gas had more than double the growth rate of renewable generation.

The Biden Administration announced a target for the US' electricity system to become carbon-free by 2035. The CAT estimates that the full decarbonisation of the US power sector by 2035 would reduce total economy-wide emissions by about 25% below 2005 levels by 2030. The goal of a carbon-free power supply by 2035 is aligned with the Paris Agreement, based on the CAT’s primary global least-cost based benchmarks (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The target also meets the IEA’s suggested net zero target year for advanced economies (IEA, 2021). If accompanied by ambitious electrification targets in other sectors, such as 100% electric vehicle (EV) sales by 2030 or the full electrification of building heating, the US would be on track to meet the target of 50%–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b).

However, emissions in the power sector must reduce more rapidly to reach the US economy-wide target. In 2021, total emissions from electricity generation had decreased by 36% compared to 2005 levels. With the introduction of the IRA, emissions from electricity generation are projected to further decrease by 67%–87% compared to 2005 levels by 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b). More recent analysis, which takes into account the recent EPA regulations in the power sector, suggests that emissions might be even further reduced to 90% below 2005 levels by 2035 (King, Kolus, et al., 2024).

Nevertheless, there remains a gap between the projections and target, highlighting the need for additional, more ambitious policies and actions.

In 2022, electricity generation from renewable sources surpassed generation from coal and nuclear power for the first time, becoming the second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j).

Increasingly cost-competitive renewables, in combination with the IRA and state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS), are expected to continue driving the growth of renewables in the electricity sector, further displacing nuclear and fossil fuel-fired power plants.

In 2023, renewables generated approximately 22% of total US electricity, with wind (10%), hydropower (6%), and solar (3%) representing the greatest shares. In 2022, solar and wind capacity increased by 5% above 2021 levels, growing to more than 238 GW. Nearly 75% of added generation capacity in 2022 were renewables. The installed capacity of solar increased by roughly 20 GW in 2023 and is projected to increase by 36 GW in 2024. The annual expansion of wind capacity lags behind solar; wind capacity only grew by 6 GW in 2023 and is forecast to increase by 7 GW in 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e).

Modelling of the IRA’s impact on renewables suggests an average capacity deployment of 54 GW/year, driven mainly by the expansion of wind and solar (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

However, according to scenarios that model a 100% clean energy power sector by 2035, annual additions in renewable energy capacity need to increase significantly. To achieve 100% renewable energy generation by 2035, the installed capacity of wind would need to grow by 70–145 GW/year between 2025 and 2035. During the same period, the installed capacity of solar would need to increase by 43–90 GW/year (Denholm et al., 2022).

The clean energy project pipeline, that is emerging as a result of the IRA, shows promising growth, having reached 309 GW of announced clean energy capacity (Cleanpower, 2024). The growth in clean energy projects is also reflected in the total project capacity seeking transmission access: in total, 1,480 GW of clean electricity generation are seeking transmission access, of which solar alone accounts for 1,086 GW (WRI, 2024).

Historically only about 14% of announced capacity gets interconnected, but the number of new projects that were announced after the passage of the IRA (e.g. more than 500 GW of solar) reflect increased developer interest and may result in a higher interconnection rate. However, major challenges for the deployment of renewables persist; complex permitting processes, higher interest rates and costs, and supply chain issues will need to be overcome to ensure project implementation (WRI, 2024).

The IRA is strengthening value chains in the medium to long term in the US by incentivising domestic manufacturing (see above), but current supply chain issues remain. While issues plaguing the solar supply chain have largely been resolved, other decarbonisation-critical equipment, such as transformers, are subject to enduring supply chain issues, resulting in long lead times (WRI, 2024).

Heightened interest rates have increased project costs, especially for renewables with high upfront costs, and have elevated prices for power purchase agreement (PPA). In turn, higher PPA prices have reduced clean energy purchases by corporates (WRI, 2024). To address risks that lead to and are associated with higher interest rates, the IRA allocates USD 3.6bn for clean energy loans to enable USD 40bn in loan guarantees, particularly targeting new technologies (Harper et al., 2023). Other instruments, such as contracts for difference, which the EU recommends to its Member States in its market design directive (European Commission, 2023), could help minimise risks and thus financing costs, especially for offshore wind (Beiter et al., 2024).

Expanding transmission lines is a major enabler for the deployment of renewables, especially wind and solar, and is essential for their overtaking of fossil gas as the primary source of electricity generation. The historical pace of grid extension of about 1% per year needs to increase to 2.3% per year to reach the full reduction potential of the IRA; a net zero pathway would require an even faster expansion (Jenkins et al., 2022). Currently, only 10% of the necessary investment in transmission infrastructure is planned (WRI, 2024).

This low level of investment is especially alarming given that transmission projects in the US take an average of 10 years to build (WRI, 2023). Although state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining and upgrading grid infrastructure, federal agencies are implementing several measures to augment investment. For instance, the US Department of Energy (DOE) introduced the Coordinated Interagency Authorizations and Permits programme (CITAP), which streamlines the permitting process for transmission facilities. The DOE also unlocked additional targeted funding to expand transmission capacity (S&P Global, 2024) and is in the process of developing auxiliary measures (WRI, 2024).

Another challenge for the power sector is the growing demand for electricity. The growth in demand is not only driven by the electrification needs of a decarbonised future, but also by the emergence of large-scale data centres, the increase in manufacturing facilities, the enhanced demand for building cooling and heating, and the introduction of hydrogen fuel plants. For example, electricity demand from data centres, which currently account for around 4% of electricity demand, is expected to grow to between 4.6%–9.1% of electricity demand by 2030 (EPRI, 2024).

Permitting and siting are major barriers for the buildout of renewable energy capacity. Current project build times average four years. The IRA includes USD 1bn to support the Biden Administration's Permitting Action Plan, which seeks to accelerate the federal permitting and environmental review process for transmission lines and clean energy productions. The federal government is also working to address issues related to project siting. The government set a target to double clean energy permits on public lands in order to reach 25 GW of renewable energy generation by 2025. This goal was reached at the end of 2023, with a total of 29 GW worth of allocated permits. A further 32 GW are currently under consideration by the government (Reuters, 2024).

Given that permitting and siting processes are largely controlled by subnational jurisdictions, action at the state level is key. California and Massachusetts have implemented promising approaches for streamlining the permitting process for clean energy projects that could be replicated by other states (WRI, 2023).

The US Department of the Interior (DOI) announced a plan to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and unlocked USD 3bn in federal loans for offshore wind and transmission projects. By the end of FY2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management aims to approve a cumulative 14.8 GW in offshore wind energy capacity to support the 2030 target (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023a). However, estimates suggest that only 14.5 GW will come online by 2030, which means the government will fall significantly short of its 30 GW target. Approximately 11 GW of planned offshore capacity have been cancelled or are being renegotiated (Canary Media, 2023).

A diverse set of drivers have been responsible for the growth of renewable energy in the US. At the subnational level, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and clean energy standards (CES) have been major drivers. In total, 32 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), accounting for 58% of US electricity sales, have enacted RPS or CES legislation. Of these, 15 states and D.C. have signed 100% clean electricity goals into legislation, while seven states have enacted such a target through state-level executive orders (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023c).

In the past, roughly half of the growth in renewable generation capacity could be associated with these standards. In recent years, however, these standards have contributed less; with current RPS or CES legislation alone the share of non-hydro RE will only increase to 28% by 2050, well below what is needed (see below).

Voluntary utility procurements, net metered PV/onsite production, and corporate PPAs have become drivers for the development of renewable energy sources (Barbose, 2023). However, these drivers are constrained by high interest rates. To ensure that sufficient renewable generation capacity is built, states could increase the ambition of their RPS or CES legislation, while states without such standards could introduce them.

At the federal level, tax credits for the production and investment in clean energy support the buildout of renewables**.** The Biden Administration modified and extended the current Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit through 2024. After 2024, the credits transition towards technology-neutral, emissions-based credits in the form of the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Energy Investment Tax Credit.

Importantly, the current tax credit applies to all projects that commence construction by 2032, providing additional investor certainty (Harper et al., 2023). Both credits incentivise investment in disadvantaged communities and provide additional bonuses to wind and solar projects in low-income neighbourhoods (The White House, 2023c). The direct impact of these credits is uncertain and difficult to assess as they overlap, complement, and engage with other incentive schemes and market dynamics.

An EPA review of scenarios estimating the IRA’s impact, which this assessment uses for the current policy projections scenario, shows that the implementation of the IRA could lead to emission reductions of between 49%–83% in the power sector by 2030 below 2005 levels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d). The modelling projects that the share of renewables in total electricity generation will increase significantly, reaching 28%–60% in 2030 and amounting to up to 85% in 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

However, these penetration levels are insufficient to meet the Biden Administration’s 2035 goal of a carbon-free power sector. In order to be aligned with a Paris Agreement-compatible, least-cost pathway, the CAT estimates that 68%–86% of the electricity generated by 2030 should come from renewable sources (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

With an increasing share of variable renewable energy in the US electricity generation mix, there is an increasing need for supply and demand-side flexibility. Storage needs will increase as gas-fired power plants, currently providing flexibility services, are phased out.

To decarbonise the power sector by 2035, approximately 120–350 GW of diurnal storage and up to 680 GW of seasonal storage is required (in a scenario that does not include carbon capture and storage (CCS)) (Harper et al., 2023). The need for utility storage and demand flexibility is also directly linked to the buildout of the transmission grid which, as highlighted above, is happening far too slowly. Building out storage capacity can reduce the need for transmission expansion and vice versa.

The IRA has spurred a significant increase in utility-scale diurnal storage projects, as evidenced by the number of storage projects awaiting interconnection. Since August 2022, more than 540 GW of storage has requested interconnection. Approximately half of that storage capacity is combined with a generation technology, mainly solar. In total, around 514 GW of storage is planned to come online before the end of 2026.

Historically, only 11% of planned storage capacity has materialised. However, the operationalisation rate might increase given that the IRA makes available the Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits for standalone storage projects. In the current storage project pipeline, battery storage dominates. The number of other storage technologies in the pipeline, notably those better suited for seasonal storage, has also increased.

In contrast to supply flexibility, demand flexibility remains underdeveloped in the US. Demand flexibility can play an important role, as transmission projects are developing too slowly, and storage projects incur additional resource use. Economic analyses suggest that large-scale demand flexibility deployment can reduce the costs of grid extension and ancillary services by approximately USD 13bn/year, while simultaneously contributing to the integration of renewables (Bronski et al., 2015).

States are beginning to recognise the importance of demand flexibility: state level institutions, such as the California Utility Commission, are starting processes to enable “widespread demand flexibility” (California Public Utilities Commission, 2022). Nevertheless, demand flexibility continues to be largely underfunded.

Seasonal storage, or long-duration storage, is underdeveloped, but will likely be critical to decarbonising the power sector by 2035. Unlike for short-term, diurnal storage, where batteries have emerged as a promising, increasingly cost-competitive technology, seasonal storage is much less mature and requires significant investments in research and development. The DOE is beginning to support seasonal storage projects; it is providing a USD 504.4m loan guarantee for a hydrogen storage capacity in Utah and introduced the Long Duration Storage Shot that aims to decrease costs for seasonal storage by 90% within the coming decade (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023c). However, the government’s efforts must be intensified to deploy the technology at the scale and pace to achieve sectoral decarbonisation.

The US government has not set a fossil fuel phase-out target for coal or fossil gas. It did not support the coal phase-out initiative at COP26, but has taken an important step since the last CAT assessment by becoming a signatory to the Powering Past Coal Alliance.

Several states have committed to phasing out coal, but states with a major share of coal generation generally have not. The federal government also recently reframed its position on phasing out fossil fuels: since May 2024, the US refers to a “a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035" after initially calling for a “carbon pollution free” electricity sector by 2035. Such reformulation opens the door for use of abated coal (e.g. with carbon capture and storage), as well as the use of coal in sectors that are not directly related to electricity generation (GEM Wiki, 2024).

In 2023, the share of coal generation continued to decline at an even faster pace than in 2022. In 2022, approximately 20% of total US electricity generation was derived from coal. This dropped to 16% in 2023, a decrease driven by the continued buildout of fossil gas generation and the growth of renewable sources.

Elevated fossil gas prices induced a temporary increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, which did not last, as gas prices returned to 2020 levels in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024c). As a result, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants reduced from 48% to 42% (Inside Climate News, 2024); a trend that reflects the worsening economics of coal but one that could be reversed in future if coal-fired power plants are not shut down.

Approximately 30% of the US coal-fired generating capacity has been retired since 2010: no new coal-fired capacity has been installed since 2013, and more coal power plants are due to be decommissioned in the near future (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021a, 2023g, 2023k). However, the retirement of coal generation capacity has slowed in recent years and is expected to continue to slow in 2024. Although the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected 8.9 GW of coal-fired power plants to retire in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g), only 5 GW actually retired (Ember, 2024). For 2024, only 2.3 GW of coal-fired power plants are set to retire (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024d). In comparison, annual coal retirements averaged 11 GW between 2015 and 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g). The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, used as one of the reference scenarios for this assessment’s current policy projections, suggests that no new coal-fired capacity will be added in the US. In the reference case, coal-fired capacity is projected to decline by 64% to 73 GW by 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023h).

This means that a full phase-out of coal power by 2035 requires additional policy action to accelerate and reinforce market forces that, as evidenced by the last decade, are pushing coal out of the mix. According to the CAT, the US needs to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2030 to be aligned with the Paris Agreement (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets existing coal-fired power plants and new gas-fired power plants. The standards cover GHG emissions, waste water, mercury, and toxic metals. The standards set the most stringent emissions limits for both plant types in US history and mandate that all coal-fired power plants reduce or capture nearly all of their CO2 emissions by 2040 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The regulation exempts coal-fired plants that are set to retire before 2032, while relaxing the standards for those retiring between 2032 and 2039; these plants need to reduce emissions by only 16%. Coal plants that operate beyond 2039 will be required to reduce their emissions intensity by implementing CCS technology to capture 90% of CO2 emissions by 2032. These requirements are expected to accelerate coal plant retirements before the 2040 deadline, resulting in an additional 22 GW of coal-fired capacity going offline between 2023 and 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The EPA’s emissions standards for fossil gas distinguish between baseload and peak power plants: the standards only apply to baseload plants larger than 300MW. Plants covered by the regulation have the option to capture 90% of emitted CO2 using CCS by 2035 or transition to 96% hydrogen fuel use by 2038. These standards are projected to reduce fossil gas emissions by approximately 200–400 MtCO2e by the mid-2040s. The combined cumulative reductions for both coal and fossil gas are forecasted to amount to 600 MtCO2e by 2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023h). While setting emissions limits for power plants is a step in the right direction, the regulation’s impact remains uncertain as smaller baseload plants and peak power plants are not covered.

The new EPA standards aim to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuel-fired power plants and explicitly allows for CCS, signalling that the government considers CCS a viable solution for emissions reductions in the mid to long term (Parenteau, 2024). However, CCS has yet to be proven commercially viable at scale, and it remains unclear whether the technology will have demonstrated commercial viability by 2040. Given the high cost of CCS applications for fossil fuel-fired power plants (Clarke et al., 2022), the CAT estimates that most fossil fuel-fired power plants that are subject to the proposed regulations will already cease operations by 2040.

If instead CCS does get deployed at scale, the widespread adoption of CCS could lead to significant additional emissions since current CCS technology only captures 90% of power plant emissions.

In the past, the EPA has met numerous legal challenges in its efforts to regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants; notable are two failed attempts during the Obama and Trump Administrations. Most recently, in June 2022, the US Supreme Court ruled to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants (West Virginia v. EPA, 2022). The decision sets a worrying precedent for future climate action. However, experts suggest the design of the EPA’s most recent standards explicitly considers the weaknesses of previously proposed regulations and, therefore, gives the standards a better chance against legal challenges (Parenteau, 2024).

In parallel, the government passed stricter standards for power plants whose pollution crosses state lines (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e). The EPA has also proposed stronger limits for mercury and water pollution from coal-fired power plants. These rules do not target pollution that directly contributes to global warming, but, nevertheless, limit the operation of coal-fired power plants and, in doing so, could indirectly accelerate their phase-out (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023g, 2023j).

Unlike coal generation, oil and fossil gas generation increased significantly in 2023. More than 10GW of fossil gas-fired power plants were added in 2023, the highest increase since 2003 (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Generation from fossil gas grew more than twice as fast as generation from renewables in 2023 (Rhodium Group, 2024).

Studies suggest that lifetime use for fossil gas-fired plants breaks even after 9–17 years of operation under current regimes. The longevity of gas-fired power plants severely hampers the phase-out of fossil gas and, as a result, either jeopardises the sector’s 2035 decarbonisation target or invites the widespread deployment of CCS if the gas-fired fleet remains in operation or is expanded (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

The US became the world’s largest producer of crude oil in 2018 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2018), reaching its highest levels of oil and gas production and exports in 2023. US crude oil exports reached a high of 4.1 million barrels per day in 2023, corresponding to a 13% increase compared to previous record export level in 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024b). Increasing exports were driven by increased crude oil production, several releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and increased demand in Europe for an alternative to Russian crude oil (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023l).

Exports of petroleum products similarly increased: more petroleum products were exported—nearly six million barrels per day—in the first half of 2023 than in the first half of any prior year. Since 2020, growth in propane exports has driven growth in overall petroleum product exports; approximately 1.5 million barrels were exported per day in the first half of 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023e).

The US is also the largest producer of fossil gas. Liquified natural gas (LNG) exports continue to increase year after year. In the first half of 2022, the US became the world’s largest LNG exporter. By the first half of 2023, LNG exports had further increased by 4% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023d). This trend is expected to continue into the future as the US is planning to increase its LNG export capacity by more than 40% by 2026, compared to 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The growth in exports is mainly driven by strong LNG demand from Europe, as well as by expanded and reopened LNG capacity. In 2022, US LNG exports to Europe increased by 141% compared to 2021 levels (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023b). Outside of Europe, interest in and demand for US LNG is also growing. In Mexico, new LNG terminals, as well as an expanding pipeline network, are contributing to growth in LNG imports from the US. In Asia, imports from the US continue to increase; Japan, China, and India increased imports in 2023 relative to 2022, while the Philippines and Vietnam imported LNG from the US for the first time in 2023 (Zaretskaya, 2024).

In January 2024, the Biden Administration took a step towards addressing the climate impacts of US fossil fuel exports by issuing a temporary pause on the development of new LNG export terminals (Daly, 2024). The administration cited outdated project evaluation criteria, which inadequately capture the financial and environmental cost of new LNG infrastructure, as cause for the moratorium. As of October 2024, the pause remains in place. It is important to note that the pause does not impact operational, as well as approved, LNG terminals and, as a result, does not immediately impact the US supply of LNG to Europe and Asia (The White House, 2024b).

Although a step in the right direction, the US should take stronger, more consistent action to phase out fossil fuel production and exportation. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest GHG emitters and richest countries in the world, the US has a responsibility and is well-positioned to phase out fossil fuels.

On the international stage, the US has signalled support for a reduction in fossil fuel production: at COP26, the US pledged to end international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022 (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021b), and at COP27, the US supported language on a “fossil fuel phasedown." However, as evidenced by ever increasing domestic oil and gas exploitation, the government has contradicted itself on this issue (CAT, 2023).

Record levels of fossil fuel production translate to record profits for oil and gas corporations. An analysis of five major fossil fuel corporations revealed that this set of companies earned USD 152bn in profit between 2017 and 2020 (Climate Power, 2024a). More recent data for 2021 through 2023 show that profits for the top ten largest oil and gas corporations by value tripled to USD 313bn under the Biden Administration in comparison to reported profits from 2017 through 2019 (McCormick & Smyth, 2024).

The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, included in the range of our current policy scenario projections, projects US fossil gas production to increase by 15% and LNG exports to increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a). This increase is due to the expected increase in domestic and foreign demand for fossil gas and a continued increase in LNG capacity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The US has one of the largest expansion plans for oil and gas projects in the world. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. With 22 oil and gas mega-project plans in place, the US accounts for more than one-fifth of potential emissions from major carbon emitting energy projects in the world. Together, these 22 mega-projects have the potential to emit nearly 143 GtCO2e in their lifetime, which is almost four times more than the entire world emits each year (Kühne et al., 2022).

Expansion of oil and gas projects is driven by planned increases in fracking and LNG extraction (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023). In 2022, subsidies for fossil fuels, as defined as budgetary transfers, tax expenditures, and general supply- and demand-side financial support, reached their highest level since 2010: subsidies amounted to USD 14bn in 2022 (Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker, 2022).

Fossil fuel subsidies have and will continue to spur the expansion of fossil fuel projects. Research indicates that two of the largest and longest standing subsidies—the ‘expensing of intangible drilling costs’ (IDC) subsidy and the ‘percentage depletion’ subsidy—increased the expected value of new oil and gas projects by upwards of USD 20bn over the past two decades (Erickson, 2021). Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which incentivises the build out of renewable energy, simultaneously enables the expansion of oil and gas production by mandating new leases on public lands for fossil fuel projects (see below on new auctions and project approvals) (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023).

To keep 1.5°C of warming within reach, GHG emissions must be halved globally by 2030 and no new oil and gas should be developed (IEA, 2023b; IPCC, 2022). Therefore, the planned investment in and development of new oil and gas infrastructure in the US obstructs progress towards the global 1.5°C temperature target, as well as the country’s 2030 climate target and 2050 net zero target, and will likely lead to significant stranded assets in a Paris Agreement-compatible future.

Beyond the IRA’s incentives for clean energy production and investment, the act also provides notable concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The act offers these compromises under the pretence of allowing domestic oil and gas companies to transition away from fossil fuels at a reasonable pace.

The IRA requires the federal government to offer an annual minimum area of specified public lands for oil and gas drilling. While the act does increase the royalty rates paid by companies for extracting fossil fuels on public lands, it also requires the prioritisation of oil and gas auctions over renewable energy on federal lands and offshore developments.

These provisions not only contradict President Biden’s promise to end new federal fossil fuel leasing of public lands, but also increase the risk of locking in fossil fuel infrastructure and creating stranded assets during the energy transition. Although the Biden Administration has already reached its 2025 target for renewable energy deployment on public lands (Groom, 2024), the continued leasing of public lands for oil and gas extraction sends a long-term signal to the fossil fuel industry that may slow the pace of emissions reductions.

The result of new fossil fuel leasing under the IRA has been the approval of several large oil and gas projects on public lands. In March 2023, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) gave its formal approval for the ConocoPhillips Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, which is the largest approved oil and gas project in the country (Chu, 2024). Although the DOI significantly reduced the scope of the project, the Willow Project is one of the few oil projects that the Biden Administration approved without a congressional or court mandate (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023b).

The approval of the project breaks Biden’s promise to stop new oil drilling on federal land and will result in significant environmental and biodiversity impacts. The project has the potential to produce over 600 million barrels of crude oil over the next 30 years, which will release nearly 280 MtCO2e in emissions (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 2023).

In 2023, the Biden Administration auctioned off 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, more than double the size of the Willow Project, for offshore oil and gas drilling. The auction generated over USD 260m, the highest bid total since 2017. While the auctioning of these offshore sites was a mandatory provision under the IRA, the government had the ability to reduce the size and scope of the sale but chose not to (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023).

In July 2023, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline to proceed. The pipeline is a 500-km-long project that will transport fossil gas from West Virginia to Virginia. The pipeline was subject to multiple lawsuits and a complex environmental permitting process as the planned pipeline will cross waterways and national forest lands. The project’s approval came after a bipartisan group of lawmakers filed an emergency request to include the project in the debt ceiling negotiations, which eliminated the ability to challenge the pipeline in court (AP News, 2023; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2023).

In September 2023, the government published new, stricter rules for offshore oil and gas leasing as part of the next iteration of its offshore leasing programme for 2024–2029 (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023). During this five-year period, only three areas of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned to fossil fuel companies. The drafting of the updated leasing programme was delayed by litigation from several states, oil and gas companies, and environmental groups (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2022).

California is the only oil and gas producing state that has moved to end production. The state banned new fracking permits from 2024 and plans to phase out oil production by 2045. California is a founding associate member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which was introduced at COP26. Washington state joined BOGA at COP27 in 2022 and has implemented measures to ban new fossil infrastructure, including oil refineries (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021, 2022). The US did not join BOGA at its founding at COP26 and has since not joined the alliance.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes a USD 21bn investment to plug and clean up abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells, which continue to emit significant amounts of methane and other pollutants long after remission (U.S. Senate, 2021). In August 2022, the DOI awarded USD 560m to 24 states to begin work on monitoring and capping methane emissions from orphaned oil and gas wells (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2022). This initiative is further supported through the IRA’s Methane Emissions Reductions Program, under which the Biden Administration announced an additional USD 350m in the first of a series of grants for states to measure and reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The programme includes funding for plugging and cleaning up abandoned well sites (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022f).


## Industry

Direct GHG emissions from industry accounted for 23% of total US emissions in 2023, making it the third largest contributor to US GHG emissions after the transport and electricity sectors.

In 2020, emissions from the industrial sector decreased by 6% due the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, sectoral emissions increased by 1% as a result of the economy’s recovery. In 2022, emissions remained stable, indicating that the sector’s emissions have not reached pre-pandemic levels again (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n).

Industrial emissions have remained largely stable over the past decade, even as the US economy has transitioned from a manufacturing to a service-based economy and as industrial processes have experienced efficiency improvements and shifted to less emissions-intensive fuels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n). Under current policies, emissions from the industrial sector are projected to remain stable or minimally decrease as a result of the counteracting forces of renewed growth in domestic manufacturing and strengthen decarbonisation policies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (King, Kolus, et al., 2024; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA funds several measures to decarbonise the industrial sector. The act provides USD 5.8bn in funding for the new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. In 2024, this programme selected, and began awarding financing to, projects in emissions-intensive industrial facilities (e.g. iron, steel, concrete sectors). The DOE estimates that the programme will reduce 14 MtCO2 annually (Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, 2024).

The IRA also expands tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and sequestration (CCUS) technology, building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s (BIL) investments in CCUS demonstrations and industrial applications (The White House, 2023b; U.S. Department of Energy, 2022d). Estimates suggest that measures under the IRA for industrial CCUS might reduce up to 240MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA includes the Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides tax credits for industrial and manufacturing facilities that invest in certain clean energy technologies. Eligible facilities either must re-tool with equipment designed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20%, re-equip, expand, or establish measures for producing and recycling clean energy equipment, or process, refine, and recycle critical materials (The White House, 2023b). A total of USD 10bn in tax credits was allocated in a first round. A second round in 2024 aims to allocate an additional USD 6bn (IRS, 2024; U.S. Department of Energy, 2024g).

The US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development of technologies that are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.

The challenging economics of many technologies in the industrial sector, such as green hydrogen and CCUS, require clear, robust incentive schemes to de-risk and attract investment (Department of Energy, 2024). Individual products, such as clean and/or green steel, might otherwise still find niche market applications (e.g. via government procurement), but will likely not be sufficiently commercialised to enable a full sector decarbonisation.

In March 2023, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalised its Good Neighbour Plan, which requires industrial facilities and power plants in 23 states to cut NOx emissions to prevent pollution across state lines. By 2026, the EPA plans to set enforceable NOx emissions control requirements, which will primarily reduce emissions from harmful air pollutants and also reduce CO2 emissions by 16 MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

In December 2020, the US Congress enacted legislation under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act to tackle hydrofluorocarbon emissions (HFC). The act directs the EPA to phase down the production and imports of HFCs by 85% until 2036. It is expected to reduce emissions by 4.7 GtCO2e by 2050 via sector-based requirements to transition to non-HFC-emitting alternatives and next-generation technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b).

In 2024, the US met its HFC phase-down target of reducing HFCs by 40% below 2020 levels (Haroldsen, 2024). The IRA provides an additional USD 38.5m to the EPA to implement the AIM Act (The White House, 2023b). We incorporate the IRA's effects on reducing non-CO2 emissions into our current policy projections through a review of studies that quantify this impact (see Assumptions section).

Hydrogen plays a central role in the Biden Administration’s roadmap for decarbonising hard-to-abate industrial processes and replacing fossil fuel-based feedstock with cleaner alternatives. The IRA established the Hydrogen Production Tax Credit to incentivise domestic production of clean hydrogen and to meet the Biden Administration’s Hydrogen Shot target, which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to USD 1 per kilogram through 2030 (The White House, 2023b). Recently, the credit has received criticism for its requirements to minimise emissions from hydrogen production, which certain actors argue are too costly (Pontecorvo, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, the transport sector accounted for 28.5% of total US GHG emissions and, since 2017, has been the largest contributor. Total sector emissions increased by 19.4% between 1990 and 2022 due to increased motorised transport demand: during the same period, the average number of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) per passenger cars and light-duty trucks increased by 46.7%. Road transport is responsible for the vast majority of transport sector emissions in the US: light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks and passenger cars accounted for 79.8% of total sectoral emissions in 2022 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes several components to decarbonise the transport sector, such as investments to improve roads, modernise public transit, and boost the electric vehicle (EV) market (U.S. Senate, 2021). The BIL includes measures to develop EV charging stations (USD 7.5 bn), strengthen the country’s EV battery supply chain (USD 7bn), update and upgrade public transportation (USD 39bn), build out ‘climate-friendly’ passenger and freight railways (USD 66bn), and invest in roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure projects (USD 110bn), as well as in clean busses and ferries (USD 7.5bn).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), alongside significant investments in electrifying light- and heavy-duty vehicles (see below), provides considerable financial support for EV manufacturing and supply chains: the IRA sets aside USD 2bn for the Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant Program, which funds the re-tooling of production lines for EVs. The act allocates another USD 3bn for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which has expanded coverage to heavy-duty vehicles, locomotives, maritime vessels, and planes. As a result, plans for 163 new battery and 117 EV manufacturing plants have been announced.

If fully realised, these plants would create over 170,000 new jobs in battery and EV manufacturing and account for over 60% of all new jobs created by the IRA (Climate Power, 2024b). By 2030, if all planned manufacturing plants are operationalised, domestic battery manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by nearly 20 times to approximately 1000 GWh/year relative to 55 GWh/year in 2021 (U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2023).

The IRA also extends the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit to spur the domestic production and sale of clean energy components, including certain EV-relevant battery components and critical minerals (The White House, 2023b). Through these measures, the IRA is expected to reduce transport sector emissions by 15%–35% by 2035 relative to 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). In combination with existing policies and the BIL, the IRA is estimated to reduce overall GHG emissions by 1,150 MtCO2e in 2030 in comparison to business-as-usual scenarios; the result is that GHG emissions are forecasted to be 40% lower in 2030 than in 2005 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022e).

In January 2023, the Biden Administration released its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation to support the 2050 economy-wide net zero target and the 2050 target of 80%–100% emissions reductions in the transport sector. The blueprint's three key strategies align with the Avoid, Shift, and Improve (ASI) framework: the strategy supports community design and land-use planning, expands access to more efficient public and private transport, and facilitates the transition to zero emission vehicles and fuels (U.S. Department of Energy et al., 2023).

The modal split for passenger transport has been and continues to be dominated by road transport. In 2022, nearly 70% of all commutes were undertaken by single-occupancy vehicles, while only approximately 9% of commuters carpooled. The share of single-occupancy vehicle commutes decreased by over 10% between 2018 to 2022. During the same period, and likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of the population working from home increased by nearly 10%. In 2022, approximately 6% of commuters used public transport and engaged active mobility (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2022).

In March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised its Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles. The standards, which will phase in from 2027 through 2032, set fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets for auto manufacturers. For light-duty vehicles, the fleet-wide average target is 170 CO2 grams/mile in 2027. By 2032, the average target for light-duty fleets will be reduced to 85 CO2 grams/mile (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i).

To meet the 2032 target, the EPA estimates that battery electric vehicles will account for 30–56% of automaker's fleets to meet the average emissions target (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024j). The resulting emissions reductions are approximated to total 7.2bn tons of CO2 through 2055 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024b).

The efforts are somewhat undermined by the fact that medium-duty vehicles—a vehicle segment that includes vans and pickup trucks and represented nearly 20% of the total US light- and medium-duty vehicle fleet in 2021—are subject to a different, less demanding set of emission standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a).

Although the updated standards are the most stringent in US history, the standards are less ambitious than equivalent regulations in the EU and the UK, where the emissions target for 2035 is 0 CO2 grams/mile for new light-duty vehicles (The International Council on Clean Transportation, 2024). The relative weakness of the US standards may be partially attributable to lobbying efforts from auto manufacturers. The EPA initially proposed more ambitious fleet-wide average targets between 2027 and 2032, but the auto lobby, spearheaded by Toyota's push for more flexibility in achieving the emissions targets, successfully watered down the standards (Tabuchi, 2024). In doing so, auto manufacturers can continue to fulfil their emission reduction targets with ICE-based vehicles, which prolongs the production and profitability of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and obstructs a faster transition towards a decarbonised transport sector.

At the state level, stricter, more ambitious EV policy has been implemented. California established a 100% EV sales target for 2035 through its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation in 2023. This regulation has been duplicated and adopted by twelve other states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) (California Air Resources Board, 2024). As a result, over one-third of all light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales in the US are subject to the 2035 100% EV sales target (IEA, 2024b).

The combined sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles made up 16.3% of all new LDV sales in the US in 2023. Battery electric vehicles accounted for approximately 7% of new car sales in the US in 2023; BEV sales reached a record of 1.1 million in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a).

The growth in BEV sales is the result of a larger selection and significant price cuts in vehicles: in 2023, 20 new BEV models were introduced, while the average transaction price for BEVs decreased by over 17% between December 2022 and December 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the gap in average transaction price between BEVs and ICE-based vehicles decreased to a record low of USD 7,000 before any purchase incentives are applied (Doll, 2024; Kelley Blue Book, 2023; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a). This means that, once government incentives are applied, certain BEVs are as or more affordable than their ICE counterparts. Beyond increases in availability and affordability, growing consumer interest and IRA incentives continue to further augmented uptake (Inside EVs, 2023).

To reduce emissions from road transport, the government set a goal for 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles (The White House, 2021d). However, this 50% target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement. To be compatible with the PA, research suggests that 95–100% of sales of new LDVs in the US should be zero-emissions by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).

Even with IRA support, the US government estimates that LDV EV sales will only reach a median of 36% in 2030 (with a range of 15%–54%) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c), which is insufficient to meet the Biden Administration's goal, let alone to meet the 1.5°C compatible benchmark (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

It is important to note that estimates for EV uptake vary substantially. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2023 estimates that the US will achieve the EV sales target of 50% by 2030 under the STEPS scenario and the International Council on Clean Transportation anticipates the LDV EV sales share will reach 48%–61% in 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). At the same time, recent US Energy Information Agency (EIA) calculations only project 13–29% EV sales in 2050 (IEA, 2023a; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023i).

The US did not sign the 100% EVs declaration at COP26. Signatories agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles (Race to Zero, 2021). Despite the absence of the federal government’s signature, many US subnational and non-state actors, including states, cities, and automakers, signed the declaration (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021a).

In March 2024, the Biden Administration, building on the set of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration in 2018, increased tariffs on a range of decarbonisation-relevant products and technologies from China. Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles increased the most: the border tax on EVs will quadruple from 25% to 100% of the import value (Tankersley & Rappeport, 2024). Although politically significant, research indicates that economic impacts will likely be limited (Sherman, 2024). In September 2024, the Biden Adminsitration, citing national security concerns, proposed a ban on all Chinese connected car hardware and software (Shepardson et al., 2024). If finalised, Chinese software would be banned starting in 2026, while hardware would be prohibited beginning in 2030.

The IRA accelerates the uptake of electric light-duty vehicles by extending and expanding tax credits for both new and used EVs. From 2023 through 2032, the Clean Vehicle Credit provides up to USD 7,500 for new battery electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell EVs that retail under USD 80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and USD 55,000 for all other types of vehicles. To qualify for the full credit, the vehicle and its critical mineral and battery components must meet certain requirements for assembly in and sourcing from North America or trusted trade partners (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024a). The result of the sourcing and manufacturing requirements is that only 22 EV models qualified for the total tax credit out of the 104 EV models for sale in May 2024 (Lambert, 2024).

Beyond targeting new EV sales, the US government seeks to leverage the maturing used electric vehicle market, which was made up of approximately 400,000 EVs in 2023 (IEA, 2024b): the Used Clean Vehicles Credit provides up to USD 4,000 to buyers who purchase a used electric vehicle for USD 25,000 or less (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024c).

Both the credits for new and used EVs are capped at different income levels to increase the affordability of and access to EVs for individuals and households with lower to middle incomes. Buyers of used EVs can also claim the credit at the time of purchase, which more immediately reduces the purchasing or monthly financing cost. As high costs remain a crucial barrier to EV adoption, reducing costs, particularly for buyers with lower incomes, accelerates and supports a just transition to EVs (Pamidimukkala et al., 2023).

The government is on track to achieve its 2030 target for 500,000 publicly accessible recharging points in 2026 (The White House, 2024a). The number of publicly accessible recharging points increased by over 70% to 170,000 stations since 2021 (U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, 2024).(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023i)

Freight transport emissions account for an increasing share of total transport emissions in the US: the share of emissions from freight transport increased from 24% in 1990 to 32% in 2021 (K. Kennedy, 2023). Trucking accounted for 65% of all freight moved by weight and made up roughly 83% of total freight transport emissions in 2021 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024f).

To mitigate emissions from trucking, the government revised emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2024 (see below). Shifting freight transport to rail, which only emitted 5.7% of total sectoral emissions in 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2023) and accounted for the greatest share of long-distance freight volumes across all modes of freight transport, has significant emissions reductions potential (Association of American Railroads, 2021).

In March 2024, the EPA adopted an updated set of vehicle emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, transit, and vocational vehicles. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles Phase 3 strengths the existing emissions standards: heavy-duty vocational vehicles need to reduce emissions by up to 60% more under the Phase 3 standards relative to Phase 2.

The revised standards will effect HDVs starting in 2027 through 2032. Between 2027 and 2055, the standards are expected to mitigate approximately 1bn tons of CO2 emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024e). In comparison, the EU, which also revised its heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards in 2024, sets a more ambitious emissions reductions target for all new HDVs for 2030, which will escalate to a 90% target for 2040.

As a first step to mainstream reductions in freight transport emissions, the Biden Administration established a national goal to transition towards a zero-emissions freight sector in April 2024. Although the administration has not indicated an explicit timeline for the zero-emissions target, separate action plans for decarbonising truck, rail, aviation, and marine freight transport are to be developed.

Since its adoption in 2022, the IRA has spurred investments and introduced provisions to reduce GHG emissions from heavy-duty transport. Through the IRA, the EPA launched the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle Program, which was revised in 2024, to provide USD 1bn in grants to states, municipalities, and Tribes to offset the costs of replacing heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emissions alternatives and installing related infrastructure; at least USD 400m of the total funding will be channelled towards communities suffering from severe air pollution (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024d). The programme's first funding round of over USD 900m opened in April 2024 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024c). The EPA estimates that 70% of the programmes funding will go towards replacing ICE-based school buses (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024a). An additional USD 3bn is allocated to provide grants to local governments, port authorities, and other relevant actors to purchase and install zero-emission port equipment and technology (The White House, 2023b).

The IRA has also introduced the Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, which defers 30% of the costs of replacing diesel or gas-powered commercial vehicles—ranging from cars to long-haul trucks —with electric vehicles. A credit of up to 15% is also available when replacing a vehicle with a partially electric alternative. The IRA also allocates USD 3bn for electrifying the United States Postal Service fleet (The White House, 2023b).

Beyond providing tax credits for buyers, the government is partnering with truck manufacturers to further develop heavy-duty EV technologies. Through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, the Supertruck 3 programme, and the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium, the US Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting the research and development of next generation of heavy-duty batteries and fuel cells (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022a).

The government is also funding commercial EV demonstration projects. In 2023, the DOE awarded over USD 7m to seven projects that will develop a medium- and heavy-duty recharging station corridor across 23 states. In 2024, the government announced that the DOE would fund the research and development of load management strategies to alleviate recharging-related grid capacity challenges.

Federal government support for commercial EV uptake has been supplemented by state action. New York and California provide additional purchase incentives of over USD 100,000 on top of the IRA’s mechanism. In response, adoption of heavy-duty EVs seems to be increasing: delivery van fleets are quickly electrifying as Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Walmart place major EV orders. Commercial production by Volvo and Freightliner of electric tractor trailers, or 18-wheelers, began in 2023.

Although there are promising signs of increasing implementation, only 1.5% of all commercial heavy-duty vehicles in the US were BEVs or PHEVs in September 2023. At the same point in time, the share of BEVs and PHEVs in the HDV fleets in Europe and China amounted to over 7% and 10%, respectively (Soulopoulos, 2023).

The IRA also seeks to encourage the development and adoption of sustainable fuel technologies in the aviation industry. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit incentivises the sale and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

The tax credit, worth USD 1.25 per gallon, is progressive: SAF that reduce emissions by more than 50% are eligible for an additional USD 0.01 per gallon for each extra percent that the reduction exceeds 50% (up to USD 0.50 per gallon) (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022c). The act additionally provides nearly USD 300m in grants to develop and deploy projects related to sustainable aviation fuel and low-emission aviation technologies (The White House, 2023b).

Although the US produced nearly 16m gallons of SAF in 2022, these fuels accounted for less than 0.1% of the total fuel used by US airlines in the same year (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2023). Additionally, analysis suggests that currently available SAF do not reduce emissions across the fuels’ full lifecycles given their emissions and agricultural resource-intensive production methods (Lashof & Denvir, 2024).


## Buildings

In 2022, direct GHG emissions from buildings accounted for 13.5% percent of total US GHG emissions; 7.3% of the sector’s emissions came from commercial buildings and 6.2% from residential buildings. When accounting for indirect, electricity-related emissions, the buildings sector made up almost one-third (31.1%) of the country’s total GHG emissions in 2022. Since 2005, total emissions—the combination of direct and indirect emissions—from residential and commercial buildings have decreased by approximately 25%. However, direct emissions from buildings have remained nearly constant since 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The Biden Administration aims to reduce emissions from buildings by 65% in 2035 and by 90% in 2050 compared to 2005 emissions levels. However, to be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT estimates that emissions from buildings in the US should already be 60% lower in residential buildings and 70% lower in commercial buildings by 2030 compared to 2015 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021a, 2021b). Achieving these levels of emissions reductions requires the complete phase-out of new fossil fuel-based energy supply installations in buildings and the rapid retrofitting of the existing housing stock to improve energy efficiency.

Developing and implementing building codes is largely the responsibility of state and local authorities. The federal government’s ability to regulate emissions from buildings is limited; the federal government can directly regulate federal buildings and, otherwise, can only provide financial support and technical guidance for state and local governments.

In April 2024, the US Department of Energy (DOE) released a national strategy to guide the decarbonisation of the building sector by 2050, which emphasises the federal government’s role in coordinating and supporting subnational governments in reaching this target (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a). The strategy outlines key actions, performance targets, and barriers to increase building energy efficiency, accelerate on-site emissions reductions, transform the grid edge, and minimise embodied lifecycle emissions.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes USD 225m for state and local implementation of energy codes. Albeit limited in comparison with other funding allocations under the BIL, these resources have largely gone towards the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation programme to support energy code adoption, enforcement, training, and technical assistance at the subnational level. In 2022, the DOE released a new building energy code for federal buildings that aims to improve energy efficiency (The White House, 2022b).

The Biden Administration’s National Initiative to Advance Building Codes unlocked USD 1bn in IRA grants to further support state and local governments in the adoption of the latest building codes and energy efficiency standards. The initiative aims to provide technical and financial support to state and local governments to modernise building codes in underserved communities, to enhance resilience to increasingly severe weather impacts, to increase household savings on utility bills, and, in turn, to further reduce residential GHG emissions.

In June 2024, the DOE released its National Definition for a Zero Emissions Building (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024e). According to the definition, a net zero energy building (nZEB) must be highly energy efficient, cannot emit greenhouse gases on-site, and is powered entirely by clean energy. It is important to note that this definition is not a binding, regulatory standard. Instead, the definition is intended to support and guide public and private sectors in decarbonising new and existing commercial and residential buildings.

At the state level, only California and Massachusetts have set targets for nZEBs in their building codes (Massachusetts State, 2022; State of California Public Utilities Commission, 2021). Due to its limited jurisdiction regarding building codes, the federal government has only set a net zero target for federal buildings (see federal buildings section below). In contrast, the EU, which is similarly legally constrained in implementing building codes, requires Member States to set domestic regulations for all new buildings to be zero emissions by 2030 and for the entire building stock to be zero emissions by 2050.

Given that the average lifetime of residential buildings is over 60 years (Aktas & Bilec, 2012), renovating and converting existing buildings into nZEBs is key to mitigating emissions from the sector. To encourage net zero renovations, the federal government provides financial incentives. However, the government does not clearly define or provide guidance on the process of converting buildings to net zero structures. In comparison, the EU provides a step-by-step, long-term guide for deep, net zero renovations through its Building Renovation Passport; the guidelines make the renovation process more accessible to homeowners and, in turn, expediate the transition to nZEBs (European Commision, 2024).

As it stands, the decarbonisation of buildings in the US will mainly rely on financial incentives for energy efficiency improvements, which, as a result, may have to rely heavily on the electrification of buildings and put more pressure on the power sector. Modelling work by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hints at the building sector’s dependency on electrification for decarbonisation: under the IRA, total emissions from buildings will decrease significantly by 2035 as the share of electricity in final energy consumption is expected to increase by nearly 5% between 2025 and 2035 (in contrast, to an increase of only 2% in the absence of the IRA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023a). At the same time, direct emissions from fuel combustion will likely remain stable; indicating that reductions in total emissions seem to be driven by a decrease in indirect, end-use electricity emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

Through the BIL, the government allocated USD 3bn to support energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in homes (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022g). The 2022 IRA builds on the BIL by unlocking nearly USD 9bn for states and Tribes to support consumer home energy rebate programmes; specifically, for programmes related to retrofitting buildings and purchasing high-efficiency electronic appliances in lower-income communities (The White House, 2023b).

The incentives aim to simultaneously reduce energy costs for homeowners and emissions from residential buildings. Via IRA funding, households that retrofit their homes and reduce energy use by at least 35% are eligible for a tax rebate worth USD 4,000. Multifamily structures can qualify for up to USD 400,000.

To further incentivise home energy improvements, the government provides tax rebates for energy efficiency upgrades, such as for installing heat pumps, insulation, doors, and windows, and for investing in residential clean energy, including rooftop solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024b).

Beyond supporting residential building upgrades, the IRA targets energy use in commercial buildings by providing tax deductions for buildings that increase their energy efficiency by at least 25% (The White House, 2023b). The BIL introduced the Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program (RLF), which channels USD 250m to states to establish revolving loan funds. With these funds, states can provide loans, grants, and technical assistance for energy upgrades and retrofits in commercial and residential buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022b, 2024d).

Embodied life-cycle carbon emissions of construction and building materials are a significant contributor to GHG emissions: embodied carbon is estimated to make up approximately 14% of building emissions (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a) and as much as 6% of total national emissions (Huynh et al., 2023).

However, there is a lack of standardised, high-quality data on embodied emissions and the federal government does not publicly release data on such emissions. Nevertheless, the government, under the IRA, has taken steps to reduce embodied emissions in buildings. In 2023, the IRA allocates USD 100m to develop standardised labels for lower-embodied carbon building materials, as well as USD 2.15bn for 150 construction projects that employ types of asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel with low embodied carbon (Chase, 2024).

Energy efficiency standards for consumer products and appliances in the US are generally ambitious; a 2023 review of the stringency of minimum energy performance standards determined that the federal government’s energy standards for electric motors, refrigerators, and water heaters meet or exceed international best practice (Mavandad & Malinowski, 2023).

The EPA’s voluntary energy efficiency labelling programme, ENERGY STAR, supports the government’s efficiency standards. The programme labels efficient products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and, in 2020, is estimated to have reduced emissions by 400 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to a 5% reduction in total national emissions (ENERGY STAR, 2023).

In 2022, the Biden Administration took over 100 actions to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a broad range of products, including household products and appliances, as well as commercial and industrial equipment. The updated standards will reduce GHG emissions by an estimated 2.4 GtCO2e over the next 30 years, or around 80 MtCO2e/year (The White House, 2022c).

In 2023 and 2024, the DOE finalised new standards for refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners and cleaners, and clothes washers and dryers. In combination, these new standards are expected to reduce emissions by an average of 19.9 MtCO2e/year over the next 30 years (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023b, 2023a, 2024c). In total, the revised standards for these products will reduce household and business energy costs by USD 8.7bn per year.

The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US and federal buildings are a principal source of the government’s emissions (Council on Environmental Quality, 2024). In April 2024, the DOE amended its energy performance standards for the new construction and renovation of federal buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024b). The revised standards explicitly require federal buildings to reduce the use of fossil fuels. According to the standards, federal agencies must reduce their fossil fuel use in new construction and major renovation projects by 90% between FY2025 and FY2029. The standards mandate that the on-site use of fossil fuels is eliminated by 2030 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024f).

In 2021, President Biden established through Executive Order numerous targets for federal operations and procurement, including reaching net zero emissions in the federal buildings portfolio by 2045 and reducing federal buildings emissions by 50% by 2032 (The White House, 2021c). In 2022, the Biden Administration issued implementing instructions on the Executive Order, which detailed the agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability mechanism to achieve such targets (The White House Council on Environmental Quality, 2022).


## Agriculture

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9% of US emissions in 2022. Between 1990 and 2022, agriculture emissions increased by 8%, primarily from the growth of the livestock sector and the intensification of farming practices. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils made up half of agricultural emissions. Enteric fermentation and manure management from livestock represented other significant emissions sources.

Agricultural emissions decreased in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, this decrease was not the result of new policy, but is rather attributable to the decline in herd size—the smallest since the 1960s—due to drought conditions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates USD 19.5bn for mitigation activities in the agriculture sector. The act mainly boosts the funding of existing conservation programmes, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) (Monke et al., 2022).

Both programmes offer financial and technical support to farmers to implement climate-friendly practices, including nutrient management, cover crops, low or no-tillage, and agroforestry. Historically, farmers have struggled to access funding under such programmes due to high demand and limited institutional capacity. These barriers could potentially be addressed by better distributing programme spending (e.g. by capping funds per farm), limiting the funding that goes to ineffective conservation practices, and increasing agency resources (Happ, 2023; Tham, 2023).

However, the efficacy of existing programmes to address on-farm emissions has come into question. Between 2019 and 2020, only one-fifth of total EQIP spending reportedly went towards the implementation of agricultural practices that directly reduce GHG emissions (Schechinger, 2022). While programmes like EQIP and CSP are now bolstered by IRA funding, they still face structural issues that may impede climate mitigation.

In 2024, 15 new practices were added to the 'climate-smart' category under the EQIP, but many of the new measures do not have proven climate benefits. A significant portion of EQIP funding goes towards manure management practices, including biodigesters that convert manure into biogas, which can be sold for profit and, therefore, may incentivise farmers to maintain or increase their herd sizes (Happ, 2024; Schechinger, 2024).

The IRA has also funded several programmes to support renewable energy use in the agriculture sector, including loans and grants for farmers who implement energy efficient equipment or underutilised renewable energy technologies (The White House, 2023b). However, certain provisions of these programmes could lead to perverse incentives. For instance, the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) subsidises biogas production. However, in combination with existing state subsidies for cattle farmers to produce biomass, REAP’s subsidies could lead to intensified livestock production (Sainato, 2022).

The Farm Bill is a policy that heavily influences farmers’ decisions on what food to produce and how to produce it. The 2018 bill expired last year, but was temporarily extended through FY2024. Its official renewal was pushed to 2024 since Congress could not come to an agreement on the contents of the new bill.

In 2024, the Republican-led House Committee on Agriculture released a draft bill that could deter climate progress in the agriculture sector. The bill would reallocate up to USD 14.4bn from the IRA that is specifically meant for climate-friendly farming practices to cover all conservation practices. The bill would also reinstate the requirement that 50% of EQIP funds are channelled to livestock operations (House Committee on Agriculture, 2024). However, the fate of the Farm Bill and its contents remain unclear as it has yet to arrive on the House floor.

There are still considerable policy gaps in addressing agricultural emissions. Beyond the structural issues of existing programmes (i.e. EQIP, CSP), the US lacks regulations or plans for addressing emissions from animal production. There are no incentives for reducing the volume of animal agriculture or for promoting plant-based foods and crops (CBD, 2020). Instead, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), which are detrimental to animal and environmental welfare, continue to be subsidised by the government (Happ, 2024).

The government also lacks policies on the demand-side. The US has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world, but food consumption patterns have not been addressed by the government. Historically, the meat industry has lobbied against key demand-side policies, such as changes to dietary guidelines, which constitute the basis of federal nutrition programmes and policy (Bottemiller Evich, 2016; Sebastian, 2024). Without a shift in diets, related emissions may increase by 9% in the US as a result of population growth (Heller et al., 2020).

The volume of food waste in the US is very high. Approximately one-third of available food is lost or wasted. Surplus, wasted food results in significant embodied emissions across the supply chain, and has been estimated to account for 6% of the country’s total GHG emissions (Harwood et al., 2023). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a goal to halve food loss and waste by 2030.

However, the target puts little focus on food losses, which occur during the production and processing stages, due to a lack of data (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o). The US is not on track to reach this target due to insufficient federal and state-level policies. Interventions to prevent food waste, such as policies on date labels, are insufficient. At the subnational level, some states hinder the recycling of food waste through bans on diverting food waste streams towards animal feed (ReFED, 2024).


## Forestry

In 2022, the net CO2 removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector corresponded to roughly 15% of total US GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, net carbon removals in the sector decreased by 13% due to the declining rate of net carbon accumulation in forests and on cropland, as well as an increase in emissions from urbanisation (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

Maintaining and increasing the carbon sink is an important component of the US government’s NDC and net zero targets. The government is a signatory of COP26’s forestry pledge, and the New York Declaration of Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030, improve and expanding forest finance and governance, and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Forest Declaration Platform, 2022).

Although the government has pledged to preserve and expand its natural carbon sink in its national policies and international negotiations, a recent study published by the US Forest Service raises concerns about the potential of US forests to store carbon in the long term. A decrease in forest area from land conversion, an increased demand for timber products, and a higher frequency of natural disturbances from climate change are reducing the ability of US aging forests to sequester carbon. Under a high wood demand scenario, US forests could even become a carbon source by 2070 (U.S. Forest Service, 2023).

To circumvent such risks, the US needs more robust forest management practices and policies. Current afforestation rates are insufficient to maintain current levels of CO2 removal, let alone meet the values presented in the government’s long-term strategy (LTS). Further incentives are needed to expand forest area, which is especially challenging on private lands (Wear & Wibbenmeyer, 2023).

Although afforestation has the largest potential to improve the carbon sink, more can be done to increase the average carbon stocks of managed forests, such as extending harvests or rotation ages. Increased investments in fire suppression and post-wildfire reforestation are necessary to mitigate wildfires and reduce their severity, which is exacerbated by climate change (S. Kennedy et al., 2024).

In 2020, then-President Trump reversed a long-standing rule that limited logging in the largest national forest, Alaska’s Tongass National Forest. The Biden Administration reinstated the protections on the forest in January 2023 by banning road-building and logging on the majority of the forest’s 16 million acres (Friedman, 2023). Considering that the Tongass makes up over one-fifth of the nation’s forest carbon stocks, its protection is critical to preserving the considerable US carbon sink (Dellasala et al., 2022).

The IRA has led to further investments (USD 5bn) in the National Forest Service and programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities. This includes grants for urban and community tree planting efforts, technical and financial assistance for landowners to boost carbon sequestration on forestland, and support for existing programmes (The White House, 2023b).

The Forest Legacy Program identifies and conserves environmentally significant forest areas that are threatened by land conversion through economic incentives. Landowners can either sell their property to the government or use a conservation easement. The programme has conserved over 3 million acres of forest land since 1990 (U.S. Forest Service, n.d.).

On the other hand, the IRA has introduced some tax measures that could drive biomass production and accelerate logging if inputs are not well-managed. Certain tax incentives for clean energy production and subsidies for advanced manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for carbon capture technologies, could be used by bioenergy companies to boost their production of forest biomass (e.g. wood pellets). The Treasury Department has not yet defined what ‘clean energy’ refers to under such provisions (Bruggers, 2024).

The US Forest Service has separate timber production targets that are highly misaligned with its responsibility to preserve and increase the carbon sink (Talbott, 2024). The agency wants to increase timber production by 25% above current levels, which is higher than any period in the past few decades (U.S. Forest Service, 2022).

The agency cites some of the reinstated protections on old-growth forests as a barrier to increased logging, and also identifies logging in regions critical to preserving high-carbon forests, such as the Pacific Northwest, as key to meeting the target (U.S. Forest Service, 2022)(Talbott, 2024). To reach the net LULUCF emissions removals needed to meet US climate targets, climate mitigation should be prioritised over timber production.


## Waste

The waste sector made up only 2.7% of national emissions in 2021 but contributed to 17% of anthropogenic methane emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). Therefore, addressing methane emissions from landfills is a key pillar of the US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. In 2021, the Biden Administration finalised emissions standards to ensure that large municipal landfills significantly reduce their methane emissions, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a Landfill Methane Outreach Program to support methane collection and distribution at smaller, unregulated landfills (The White House, 2021b).

The IRA has not led to significant policies or programmes in the waste sector, aside from some funding to improve methane monitoring and to develop a better method to measure fugitive methane sources (e.g. landfills) (The White House, 2023b).

Recently, the EPA has been sued by environmental groups for failing to update its landfill emissions accounting methodology, which it has not revised since 1998. The current emissions factors reportedly underestimate the emissions released from landfills from several pollutants, including nitrogen oxide, by as much as 25%. As a result of the lawsuit, the EPA has agreed to evaluate whether methodology needs updating and to suggest new emissions factors in case updating is required (Quinn, 2023).


## Methane

Methane is an important source of GHG emissions in the US, representing 15% of total GHG emissions in 2022, which are split between the oil and gas industry (37%), agriculture (36%), waste (19%), and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (8%) sectors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o).

Alongside the EU, the US spearheaded the launch of the Global Methane Pledge. The Biden Administration released its Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan in 2021. The plan seeks to reduce emissions from all major sources through regulations, financial incentives, and public-private partnerships.

The plan also includes USD 20bn in new investments targeted at reducing methane emissions (The White House, 2022a). The IRA provided USD 1.5bn for the Methane Emissions Reduction Fund, which aims to monitor and reduce emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems through financial and technical assistance, but also potentially locks in new “brown” infrastructure. It also established a ‘waste emissions charge’ per ton of methane emissions to oil and gas facilities that exceed emissions thresholds (The White House, 2023b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions are based on the 1990–2022 inventory emissions developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). The national inventory was reported in AR5 Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. We converted all values to AR4 GWP.


## NDC and other targets

For the 2030 NDC target, we apply the indicated target of 50%–52% reduction to the 2005 base year including LULUCF, and then subtract the projected emissions for the LULUCF sector. The LULUCF emission projections in 2030 were taken from the 5th Biennial Report which reported sinks of 0.6–0.8 GtCO2e/year in 2030 (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

For the net zero target, we assume total GHG emissions in 2050 are balanced by projected sinks in 2050. The LULUCF sinks in 2050 were taken from the US long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Since the document does not provide exact figures, we have extracted the approximated figures from the graphs in the report. The reading of the graphs results in an approximation of minus 0.6-1.4 GtCO2e/year for LULUCF sinks in 2050, we add this sink to the residual estimate in 2050 to get 0.6-1.5 GtCO2e/year in 2050. We include also estimates for 2040 in our pathway using a similar approach.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections were generated in five steps:

- First, we estimate the total emissions projections under current policies as the aggregation of the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors:GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical, and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e).

We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).

We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- Second, each of the above emissions categories was harmonised to historical data for each sector by applying the estimated annual percentage change from the projected dataset to the base year. The projections for all sectors were then aggregated to obtain total GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF. These projections are the baseline scenarios.
- Third, the quantification of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in non-CO2 emissions and in non-energy sectors:Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fourth, the quantification of the AIM Act, which was not part of the policies considered in the baseline scenario taken from Global Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections & Mitigation Potential:Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target.

We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.
- The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.

- The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fifth, economy wide emission projections from a 2024 study by the Rhodium Group (King, Kolus, et al., 2024) were included in the analysis as well, after deducting LULUCF sinks based on the 5th BUR. The study includes additional policies, including the impact of the EPA's emissions standards for vehicles beginning in model year 2027 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i) and the EPA's pollution standards for fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m). This study represents the lower end of the current policy projections range.

# Targets


## Target overview

In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the US has set a target to reduce emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (U.S. Government, 2021). This target covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (GHGs). The CAT assessment excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target, resulting in a 45%–50% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. The CAT rates the US domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution.

The US submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, officially committing to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).


## NDC Updates

The US submitted its current, more ambitious NDC target on 22 April 2021. President Biden moved to re-join the Paris Agreement on his first day in office in 2021. In line with its re-joining the agreement, the US submitted a strengthened NDC, in which the government commits to reducing emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF).

The CAT estimates that the target would translate to a range of 3,790–4,131 MtCO2e absolute GHG emissions in 2030, excluding LULUCF (or 45%–50% below 2005 levels), depending on whether the sink from LULUCF is at the high or low end of the projections (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

The current NDC target represents major progress beyond the Obama-era target of 26%–28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Nevertheless, the NDC is not ambitious enough to bring US domestic emissions in line with what would be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.

CAT analysis indicates that the US should aim to reduce its national emissions by at least 58% below 2005 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF) and provide support to other countries in order to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Doing so will also put the US on track to achieve the Biden Administration’s 2050 net zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b). The US has not submitted an update to its NDC since 2021, even though the Glasgow Climate Pact mandates countries revisit and strengthen their NDCs.

* The ‘Critically insufficient’ rating was based on the fact that the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and was not an assessment of the NDC emissions level, which itself would fall in the ‘Insufficient range’ based on the CAT’s prior rating system (which was updated in September 2021).

- 12.12.2019 “The U.S. expected to rejoin the Paris Agreement in early 2021, bringing back the US leadership in climate action”
- 04.11.2019 “The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement”

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what would qualify as a country’s fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The US does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excluding emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry or LULUFC) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.**

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Although the target represents a significant improvement compared to its first NDC, the current target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvements.

NDC target against fair share

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that US’ NDC target for 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The US target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. The target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow US’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The US’ international climate finance contributions is rated “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve the US’ fair share rating.

We rate the US’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically insufficient.” The US has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been much lower than its fair share. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuel financing abroad (and not only coal).

The US Congress approved a budget allocation for international climate finance of no less than USD 0.9bn (Congressional Research Service, 2024) for FY2024, although the Biden Administration requested an allocation of USD 5bn. As a result of a more stringent federal spending cap, the FY2024 finance provision is less than the provision in the first years of the Biden Administration (Thwaites, 2024). For FY2025, the administration accordingly reduced its requested funding to USD 3.5bn.

The US State Department, however, claims it is on track to reach its pledge to contribute USD 11.4bn per year by 2024, with a projected contribution of USD 9.5bn in FY2023 (U.S. Department of State, 2024). The difference between the climate finance commitment approved by Congress and the total claimed by the State Department is due to the fact that Congress’ funding only represents a small share of US’ total international climate finance, as other agencies contribute the bulk of financing (Thwaites, 2024; U.S. Department of State, 2024). However, the sources of the US’ climate finance are not transparently reported.

While Congress’ budget allocation does not include any funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the US government has pledged to contribute USD 3bn to the GCF. The GCF is the primary international vehicle for supporting developing countries in their efforts to respond to and build resilience to the climate crisis (DeLauro, 2022).

The commitment of USD 11.4bn per year by 2024 falls short of the US’ fair contribution. While the OECD reported in 2022 that international climate finance provided by developed countries exceeded the USD 100bn goal per year for the first time, a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” for post-2025 is already being discussed by UNFCCC parties (UNFCCC, 2024).

To demonstrate global leadership on climate finance and to contribute towards its fair share, the US needs to substantially scale up its international climate finance provisions. The CAT finance rating would improve if the US were to successfully augment its level of finance through a sustained upwards trend in annual contributions.

The US has historically provided a significant portion of its climate-related financial contributions as grants, which are more concessional than loans. Climate finance contributions declined during the Trump Administration, but this trend has since been reversed by the Biden Administration, which in 2021 increased its bilateral climate-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) (OECD, 2022).

Bilateral climate finance by the US, as reported as principal and significant financing, further increased in 2022 as a result of an increase in adaptation financing. Principal mitigation financing actually decreased by half, from almost USD 1bn to less than USD 500m, reflecting a shift by the Biden Administration towards adaptation financing (OECD, 2024). Overall, the US' allocation of funding to bilateral climate-related ODA increased from 3% in 2021 to 10% in 2022 of total ODA spending, but remains well below the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries' average of 24% (Donor Tracker, 2021, 2023). This continues to highlight a substantial shortage in the US' financial commitment to addressing climate change through ODA. Increasing these contributions would not only allow the US to play a larger role in global climate action, but would also align with its renewed commitment to international cooperation under the Biden Administration.

The US, along with several other countries, agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” by the end of 2022 (The White House, 2021a). The 2023 G7 Communique claims to have achieved this goal (The White House, 2023d). However, the US has neither developed plans nor introduced policies to implement this commitment. The US also has not supported a proposal put forward by the European Union to end fossil fuel finance from export banks (E&E News by POLITICO, 2024).

In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the US (EXIM), an independent US government agency that provides concessions for projects that seek to boost US exports, continued to lend money to foreign fossil fuel projects, including USD 100m to Indonesia’s national oil company to expand an oil refinery and boost production. Estimates suggest that EXIM’s total lending amounted to USD 1bn in 2023 (Aronoff, 2023).

While the US government claims to be actively working with EXIM to end its financing of fossil fuel projects, the export agency itself does not seem to take a proactive role in doing so, claiming it has no jurisdiction to end these projects (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). In January 2024, EXIM’s lack of action resulted in two members of the agency’s climate advisory board resigning over a decision to support a fossil fuel project in Bahrain (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024). EXIM plans to finance further fossil fuel projects, including in Guyana, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea (Friends of the Earth US, 2024).

Although the US has not approved any new domestic coal projects in more than a decade (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024), the US continues to support existing coal projects abroad, such as the Jawa 9-10 Suralaya Coal Plant in Indonesia and the Long Phu 1 Coal Plant in Vietnam (EndCoal, 2020). The US should stop supporting all fossil fuel developments abroad to improve its climate finance rating.


## Net zero target

The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, in which the US officially commits to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning (U.S. Department of State, 2021).

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping in its target coverage. It could also explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without the use of international offsets.

The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The US government should further explain how its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

**For the full analysis of the net zero target, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

The effects of COVID-19 induced a temporary drop in emissions that helped the US meet its 2020 targets under the Copenhagen Accord. Total emissions in 2020 decreased by 22% below 2005 as a result of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. The US 2020 target was to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 (U.S. Department of State, 2010). Despite reaching the 2020 target, GHG emissions bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.


# Summary


## Overview

**Under the Biden Administration, the US has seen promising signs of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is mobilising historic levels of investment in clean energy solutions and activating subnational and non-state action on climate change. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recently revised regulations in the power and transport sectors further enhance the government’s climate policy package.**

**Although the country has made progress under the Biden Administration, the US will still be far from meeting its domestic climate target—let alone aligning its emissions with a 1.5°C trajectory—without additional, drastic emissions reductions measures. To meet its domestic target, the US would need to bolster its policy packages at the sectoral level to address the rising demand for electricity across sectors.**

**The government would also need to reverse the trend of increasing fossil fuel extraction.** **CAT analysis**** in 2022 shows the US is also moving in the wrong direction regarding its international support for fossil fuels. Overall, the CAT rates the US climate targets, action, and climate finance at the end of the Biden Administration as “Insufficient”. An assessment of the impact of the Trump Administration will follow once information is available.**

On 5 November 2024, former President Donald Trump won the US election, and will take office on 20 January 2025. The US will continue to face the challenges in meeting its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and achieving future climate goals aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. Reaching these targets will require the implementation of additional policies, which may prove challenging under the Trump Administration. However, opportunities remain for climate action at the state and municipality level and for furthering the progress made under the IRA.

As of 2022, the US has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target. CAT current policies projections, which include the IRA, show a more pronounced reduction in emissions until 2030 compared to historic reductions. Although CAT projections suggest the US will close the gap by an additional 30%–44% by 2030, it is still 23%–37% short of meeting its 2030 emissions reduction target; evidence that further action is critically necessary. The current US target of 50–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 is not 1.5˚C compatible.

**Although there have been positive developments under the IRA, oil and gas production** **has increased under the Biden Administration.** The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record-level production in 2023. The country is also the worlds' largest fossil gas producer and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter for liquified natural gas (LNG). In 2022, fossil fuels also received the largest subsidies from the government since 2010. In early 2024, the Biden Administration placed a temporary moratorium on pending LNG export terminals. However, the administration continues to approve large-scale fossil fuel projects.

**The IRA has had its most positive impact on the power sector**. The government’s decarbonisation target for the power sector aligns with the CAT’s Paris Agreement-compatible benchmarks, as well as with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero strategy: by 2035, the US aims to achieve net zero emissions in the sector. The IRA has stimulated large investment in technologies critical for decarbonising the power sector, but barriers remain; especially since the demand for electricity is expected to grow significantly. Important areas for the power sector's transition, such as the electricity grid, have been significantly underfunded. The anticipated coal phase-out, as out outlined in the recently revised EPA standards, will be too late to be Paris Agreement compatible, and fossil gas-fired plants are largely exempt from the standards.

**In the transport sector, the IRA has particularly supported the manufacturing and uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), while the EPA has enhanced the regulatory framework for EVs by revising its emissions standards until 2032.** The government aims to decarbonise the sector by 2050. However, this timeline is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The IRA has spurred significant investment in the domestic EV value chain, especially in battery manufacturing, and the deployment of HDVs in commercial and public fleets. The act also expands subsidies for EV purchases and unlocks new funding for public transport.

**A major ambition gap continues to exist in the industry sector, where the government has set a decarbonisation objective but has not specified a clear timeline for reaching the objective.** The IRA provides a patchwork of instruments to support technologies to decarbonise the industry sector. The IRA unlocks billions in funding for industrial technologies in their research and development phase, while introducing and expanding tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage deployment, renewable energy and critical material projects, and clean hydrogen production. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM) continues to phase down F-gases significantly.

**The government’s emissions reductions targets for the buildings sector are not aligned with the Paris Agreement.** Due to limited federal measures to regulate building energy use and emissions, the decarbonisation of the sector will likely heavily rely on electrification. Without further efforts to reduce building envelope energy use and emissions, this dependency will put increasing pressure on the power sector and its decarbonisation.

**The agriculture sector lacks a clear decarbonisation objective and, while the IRA allocates funding to boost conservation programmes, the act’s measures do not seem to meaningfully reduce sectoral emissions and even include funding for livestock production.** The US has neither developed or implemented any regulations to address emissions from animal production, nor has it meaningfully encouraged dietary change. Such demand-side changes could result in large mitigation impacts in the US, which has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world.

**Net forest sinks are threatened by land conversion, increasing demand for timber products, and more frequent natural disturbances from climate change.** The IRA increased funding for the National Forest Service and other programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities, but logging efforts are nevertheless set to increase.

**Aside from strengthening its sectoral policies and targets and reducing fossil fuel exploitation and exportation, the US should address gaps in its international climate contributions:**

- **Increase international climate finance contributions and cease funding fossil fuels abroad.** The Biden Administration is still far from reaching its pledge of USD 11.4bn/year. In FY2023, only USD 1bn was appropriated for climate finance by the US Congress. The US also broke its commitment to stop financing fossil fuels abroad when the American Export-Import Bank (EXIM) lent USD 100m to Indonesia to expand an oil refinery in May 2023.
- **Increase the ambition of its NDC.** The US has not yet updated its climate target despite the commitment to do so by countries at COP26 in 2021. For the US climate target to be compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory, the country must reduce its emissions by at least 62%–65% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF), while providing more financial support to other countries.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the combination of the US 2030 climate targets, policies, and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the totality of the government’s policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The US 2030 domestic emissions reduction target (NDC) is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways, but not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. US policies and action lead to falling emissions in 2030, but not by enough to meet either its targets or the 1.5°C limit.

The US does not meet its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its domestic targets and policies, needs to provide and mobilise further support to developing countries.

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its mitigation targets. The CAT projects US GHG emissions in 2030 to be 29%–39% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), falling short of its 2030 NDC target (44%–49% excl. LULUCF), and significantly short of its fair share target.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. Although the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry, it is the most ambitious climate policy package in US history and brings the country closer to meeting its 2030 target.

Although the IRA is a major step towards achieving the US NDC, the government still needs to introduce additional policies and action to achieve its domestic emissions reduction target. EPA standards in the power and transport sector passed in 2024 are important complementary instruments. However, more ambitious (sectoral) climate policies at the federal and state levels are still needed to reach the US targets. The increasing trend in oil and gas production also needs to be reversed.

The projected emissions trajectory range in this update is wider than in the previous update, due to the inclusion of a broader set of models to estimate the IRA's impact. The range of policy projections for the US falls into the “Insufficient” category but reaches the “Almost sufficient” category at its lower end.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the government’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvement to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**See full summary of** **policies and actions here****.**

We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US domestic target for 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the US target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The CAT’s assessment of the US’ total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the 2030 target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of further financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

We rate the United States’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on the government’s 2022 OECD contributions. The Biden Administration committed to increase its climate finance contributions but contributions until 2024 remain low compared to its fair share. In FY2024, only USD 1bn (approximately the same amount as in 2023) were appropriated for climate finance by Congress.

While the government claims larger sums have been made available (notably, USD 5.8 bn in 2022), these funds mainly relate to adaptation and/or are not principal financing. Only principal mitigation financing is accounted for in the CAT's rating. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and stop supporting fossil fuels abroad.

The US’ climate finance is not sufficient to improve the rating of its NDC against its fair share, and the CAT rates the US’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

We evaluate the US net zero target as: **Average.** The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), in which the US officially commits to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 latest.

The net zero target covers all GHG emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature- and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target, such as including international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly committing to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

The Biden Administration submitted the US long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), officially committing the US to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by land-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping to its target coverage, and explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets. The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The government further ought to explain how and why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

The foreseen use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the government’s plan is concerning given that CCS is not commercially viable due to its high additional costs and does not reduce the emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). Modelling exercises examining a net zero power sector by 2035 highlight that under a variety of scenarios considering different technology options, fossil CCS plays a diminishing or no role at all (Denholm et al., 2022). While the strategy acknowledges the uncertainties around carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, further emissions reductions efforts should be undertaken to reduce the significant amount of CDR required in the strategy: CDR should only be treated as a last-resort option.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The US government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Emissions coverage** – The US net zero target includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The US government deliberately excludes international aviation and shipping from its net zero target’s coverage (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The US government reserves its right to use international market mechanisms towards the achievement of this net zero goal (U.S. Department of State, 2021), even if it currently does not expect to do so.
- **Legal status** – The US government submitted its updated long-term strategy (LTS) including its net zero announcement to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The net zero target has not yet been enshrined in law as of November 2024.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The US government does not provide separate emissions reductions and removal targets. However, the US provides projections on its use of direct air capture (DAC) and LULUCF in its LTS.
- **Review process** – The LTS specifies that progress toward the net zero target will be regularly assessed without providing further specific information on the envisioned process. The government has indicated that it may update the LTS in the future, but has not committed to any legally-binding revision process.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The US government provides transparent assumptions and pathways on both natural sinks and technology-based CDR towards 2050 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Land‑based sinks reach roughly 600–1,400 MtCO2e in 2050, while technology-based CDR reaches roughly 300–500 MtCO2e in 2050. On the latter, no detailed information is provided on storage capacities for captured carbon emissions, nor the combination of technologies envisioned to increase this sink. As the CAT’s net zero evaluations across all countries highlight, this represents a higher reliance on CDR compared to the average of the other G20 countries that are member of the Climate Neutrality Coalition: on average G20 countries have 5% residual emissions in the target year whereas the US include 8%-23% residual emissions in 2050 as a share of 2019 emissions.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The updated LTS presents multiple pathways and a set of transparent assumptions to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The government has outlined multiple measures and actions across different sectors, most prominently to fully decarbonise domestic electricity supply by 2035 (assuming a substantial increase of electricity generation capacity using fossil fuels equipped with CCS in 2050).Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.
- The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The US government makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The Trump Administration’s move to exit the Paris Agreement will effectively annul the 2035 climate target submitted by the Biden Administration in late 2024. More importantly and more materially, the Trump Administration’s actions to dismantle policies and rescind funding for climate change mitigation means that limiting peak global warming to 1.5°C will be even more challenging and will require other countries to make more rapid and even deeper emissions reductions. The Trump Administration’s climate agenda is seriously risking a high, multi-decadal overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s long-term 1.5°C temperature limit, even if a future US administration strengthens its targets and actions.

The 2035 NDC submitted by the Biden Administration can still act as a guide for subnational and non-state entities to continue climate action in the US, even as the Trump Administration has initiated the process to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, it should be noted that the Biden era 2035 climate target is not 1.5˚C aligned. Therefore, subnational actors seeking to advance Paris-aligned action must go beyond this target and its measures.

The Biden Administration's NDC sets a 2035 target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 61–66% below 2005 levels. The target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT, which excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), finds that the target results in 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035. This target is not 1.5°C-compatible against modelled domestic pathways: a 1.5°C compatible emissions level, excluding LULUCF, would be 2,200 MtCO2e in 2035.

At the time the Biden Administration submitted the NDC, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were the central federal mechanisms for driving emission reductions towards the 2035 target. However, under the CAT's current policy projections—which consider the impact of the BIL and IRA and were developed before the Trump Administration took office—the US will not reduce emissions fast enough to reach the 2035 target.

To reach the Biden Administration’s target, the US government would have needed to implement new, additional climate policies and actions; an outlook that the Trump Administration has rendered unlikely, as it has already taken executive actions to repeal existing climate policies, including the BIL and IRA, limit federal funding for climate action, and expand fossil fuel production.

The Biden Administration worked in close collaboration and cooperation with subnational actors in state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments to develop the 2035 target. If the Trump Administration continues to obstruct and undo climate policies, subnational and non-state actors need to slow the impact of the federal rollback of climate policies by strengthening climate action at the subnational level.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The US’ submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The submitted NDC of 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, the US would need to reduce its emissions, excluding LULUCF, to 2,225 MtCO2e in 2035. The 2035 NDC does not increase the 2030 NDC target’s ambition.

The US 2035 economy-wide target does not include specific sectoral plans and targets. The NDC does outline the key federal policies in the power, buildings, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors that were expected to drive emissions reductions towards the 2035 target. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—both of which were developed by the Biden Administration and were introduced after the US 2030 NDC submission—are described as the principal national-level policies for achieving the 2035 target. The BIL aims to expedite the development and implementation of clean energy infrastructure. The IRA is intended to mobilise unprecedented public and private investment in clean energy production. In combination, the BIL and IRA were planned to incentivise and accelerate climate action across the US economy and, since their introduction, have already reduced emissions.

It is important to note that the future of both the BIL and IRA is uncertain. The Trump Administration has already taken executive action to freeze federal funding under both laws, and has signalled that it will try to roll back certain components. While the Trump Administration cannot use executive action to unilaterally repeal either the BIL or IRA, Republican majorities in the House and in Congress may be supportive of and carry out the administration’s agenda. As of October 2024, Republicans voted 53 times in the House and once in the Senate to repeal certain climate provisions in the IRA since its introduction in 2022.

The NDC explicitly draws attention to the US federal governance structure and highlights the importance and capacity of state and other subnational governments to contribute towards the 2035 target. State governments are especially well-positioned to reduce emissions in the power, transport, and buildings sectors. However, if the Trump Administration, with support from the Republican majority in both the House and Congress, permanently restricts funding or reverses regulations for the BIL and IRA’s implementation, it is unclear whether subnational entities would be able to make up the lack of federal funding and policies.

The 2035 NDC does not include a renewable energy capacity target. Instead, the document references the US power sector target of generating 100% “clean,” “carbon pollution-free" electricity by 2035. This target is not—and should not be—conflated with a renewable energy target. The target’s formulation allows the government to use fossil energy with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), as well as nuclear and biomass energy, to achieve the target. The NDC cites the current share of renewable energy generation, which has more than doubled over the past decade; in 2023, renewables generated 21% of the US electricity.

The NDC claims the 2035 target is fully aligned with its net zero pathway; it argues that “the entire 2035 range is on a straight line or steeper trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 for all greenhouse gases.” To achieve its net zero target, the CAT estimates the US needs to reduce emissions to 558–1,540 MtCO2e or 80-93% below 2005 levels in 2050, excluding LULUCF. Assuming the US realises its 2030 NDC target, the 2035 NDC target is aligned with the median net zero pathway, but not the pathway’s uppermost bound. Further information on the US net zero target can be found here.

The NDC explicitly refers to the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake. The NDC outlines targets, measures, and metrics that correspond with some of the Global Stocktake’s sectoral goals. Highlights include references to the US expansion of renewable energy generation, the rate of electrification and energy efficiency improvements, the adoption of zero- and low-emissions vehicles, and the commitment to halting and reversing deforestation by 2030. It is important to note that the US does not commit to phasing out either fossil gas or coal.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries.

In its 2035 NDC, the US does not acknowledge its responsibility, nor communicate its intention to provide and mobilise climate finance to other countries. The US did not do so in its 2030 NDC either. Developed countries, like the US, are expected to complement their domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The US submitted 2035 NDC is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reductions target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the still significant emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The US 2035 NDC details the planning processes behind the target’s development and the existing measures for its implementation. However, the CAT finds that the US would need to go beyond the Biden Administration’s policies and actions and enact new measures to reach the 2035 target. The Trump Administration has vowed to reverse the Biden Administration's course on climate action and has already taken executive action to undermine many of the policies that underpin the NDC. The administration’s initiation of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement essentially voids the NDC, and the administration's actions entirely compromise the target’s credibility.

The US needs to implement new, additional climate policies and actions to reach its 2035 target, as current policies are insufficient. The CAT estimates that existing policies will reduce emissions by 33–50% below 2005 levels in 2035, emitting 3,780–5,071 MtCO2e in 2035, well below a 1.5˚C compatible level of 2,225 MtCO2e.

The 2035 NDC’s development was coordinated and managed by the Biden Administration’s White House Climate Policy Office. Central to the target’s development was a bottom-up analysis of existing and possible policies at the national, subnational, and non-state level.

The revision was drafted in consultation and cooperation with a broad, diverse coalition of state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments, as well as workers unions, private sector representatives, civil society organisations, and higher education institutions. In doing so, the NDC acknowledges the important role of subnational and non-state climate action.

While the NDC highlights the importance of subnational and non-state climate action, it also identifies national-level policies that are key to the realisation of the 2035 target. The BIL and IRA are described as “the backbone of the suite of existing federal legislation and investments that are contributing to the achievement the 2035 NDC target.” However, the future of these policies is uncertain. The Trump Administration has signalled that it will try to eliminate components of the BIL and IRA and has also initiated processes to reverse emissions standards in the power and transport sectors; the standards that were strengthened under the Biden Administration and are cited in the NDC as important components for realising the 2035 target.

In its NDC, the US does not commit to discontinuing fossil fuel exploration, production, or subsidies. The US is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and fossil gas. Since 2022, the US is the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG). The US government continues to heavily subsidise fossil fuels: in 2023, fossil fuel subsidies totalled nearly USD 15bn. The US plans to expand oil and gas production and increase LNG exports. The US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) most recent projections of the US energy market forecast that fossil gas production will increase by 15% and LNG exports will increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest emitters in the world, the US has a responsibility to take ambitious action to phase out fossil fuels.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emissions reductions target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) to ensure they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The US 2035 NDC target is not based on an absolute value. Instead, the target is formulated as a percentage reduction below 2005 levels.

The NDC target covers all sectors, including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The NDC does not break down the economy-wide target by sector. As a result, it is unclear how each sector would contribute to meeting the target. The inclusion of the LULUCF sector’s emissions, which are uniquely challenging to account for, undermines the target’s transparency.

The target considers all greenhouse gas emissions, but does not set targets for specific greenhouse gases. However, the NDC anticipates a reduction of methane emissions of at least 35% below 2005 levels in 2035. The NDC also forecasts “significant emissions reductions from other non-carbon dioxide super pollutants.”

The 2035 NDC does not define a specific emissions pathway, claiming “the NDC is built on the premise that there are multiple pathways to achieving the expected level of emissions reductions.” The NDC does not provide any further clarification on the number of and differences between pathways.

In the NDC, the US does not transparently communicate the intended or expected contribution of the carbon dioxide removals (CDR) or carbon markets. The NDC leaves the door open for the use of contentious voluntary carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; the NDC notes, in the case that the US relies on carbon markets to achieve its target, the government would appropriately report the use of such market mechanisms.

# Policies & action

According to our analysis, the US will need to implement additional policies to reach its targets. We project GHG emissions will reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e in 2030 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF). This is equivalent to 29%–39% reduction from 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), which is insufficient to meet the NDC target (45%–50% excl. LULUCF).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, represents a significant milestone in US climate policy. While its full impact is still unfolding due to the nature of its 10-year implementation plan, the first years have shown real promise. The IRA is mobilising historic investments in clean energy, driving clean projects, creating jobs, and attracting private sector funding. EPA standards for the power and transport sectors, passed in 2024, provide two further milestones in important policy areas.

However, to achieve its domestic emissions reductions target—let alone to reach a 1.5°C-compatible emissions level—the government needs to complement its recent advancements with further sector-specific policies and a shift away from fossil fuels.

The projected emissions trajectory range is wider in this update than previously, due to the incorporation of new analyses that better highlight the uncertainties related to the IRA's implementation. While the middle of the policy projections' range falls into the “Insufficient” category, its lower end, representing a positive outlook on the government’s current policies, falls into the “Almost sufficient” range.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the US’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The Biden Administration has set the goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, which is consistent with a Paris Agreement pathway.

## Policy overview

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its 2030 and long-term targets. After an increase in GHG emissions between 2021 and 2022, emissions started to decline in 2023 (-1.9%) (Rhodium Group, 2024). The government has set a target to reduce emissions by 3.8–4.2 GtCO2e/year in 2030.

According to our projections, emissions are forecasted to decline at an average of 1.7%–3.9% per year and reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e/year by 2030 (29%–39% below 2005 levels; and 19%–31% below 1990), excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Under these projections, the US would achieve 64%–87% of its emissions reductions target in 2030, indicating a gap of 13%–36% that would need to be filled with new and additional climate policies and action. As it stands, the 2030 target is not 1.5˚C compatible. Reaching a level in line with a global least-cost pathway requires further reductions of 1.4–2.2 GtCO2e below the current policy pathway.

Compared to CAT projections in August 2023, our range of emission projections includes an updated estimate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) impact, as well as estimates of the impact of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2024 regulations for the power and transport sectors. As a result, the US emissions projections decreased relative to the CAT’s previous projections, while the range, based on existing policies, widened for 2030–2035. The upper bound decreased by 2% and the lower bound decreased by 8%. The reduced, widened range in emission projections highlights the continued effort by the US government to cut emissions, while recognising the high uncertainty of policy outcomes; especially for the government’s flagship climate policies, including the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

The IRA injects USD 370bn into the US economy over a 10-year period. This infusion takes the form of tax credits, grants, and loans intended to develop and deploy the clean energy technologies and investments that are essential for the economy's decarbonisation (The White House, 2023a).

Since the IRA's implementation in 2022, the country has witnessed a significant surge in public and private investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure: between August 2022 and February 2024, investment in announced clean energy projects and infrastructure totalled USD 352bn. Specific highlights include record investment in battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and in grid and transmission infrastructure (Climate Power, 2024c).

Due to these investments, the share of clean energy investments in total investments increased from 3.7% in Q4 of 2022 to 5% in Q4 in 2023, representing a significant uptick in the role that clean energy investments play in the US economy (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). Given the scale of public investment, some studies suggest that the IRA could spur USD 3tn in private investments over the coming decade (Goldman Sachs, 2023).

The BIL and IRA, alongside the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, have set the stage for record private investment in the construction of domestic manufacturing facilities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023b). Before the IRA and CHIPS Act were signed, annual investment in manufacturing construction remained below USD 150bn. Since the acts’ passage, investment surged to an all-time high of USD 223bn by February 2024 (FRED Economic data, 2024; Joint Economic Committee, 2024).

Investment in the EV supply chain, especially in battery cell manufacturing and critical mineral production, has increased significantly and accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clean manufacturing investments by the end of 2023 (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). As a result of this increase in investment, the US surpassed the EU in battery cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, even though the EU’s capacity was two times larger than the US’ capacity in 2021 (Delgado et al., 2024).

These investments contribute to job creation, with estimates showing that the IRA’s provisions have already generated over 270,000 clean energy jobs (Climate Power, 2024b). The act has also contributed to a more just energy transition by targeting disadvantaged communities and rural areas. Many of the announced investments specifically target and aim to contribute to the economic development of these regions and communities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023a).

In early 2024, the US expanded its climate policy portfolio through the addition of several EPA policies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i, 2024l). The EPA introduced several standards for gas and coal-fired power plants and updated its vehicle emissions standards. Even though these standards were watered down before their finalisation (see Electricity generation and Transport sections below), they add an important regulatory complement to the incentive-based IRA: by setting yearly emissions levels for technologies, the standards provide important guidance for the private sector.

To realise its 2030 and 2035 targets and to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5˚C temperature goal, the US has to implement further, more ambitious policies and measures. Additional measures could focus on those sectors in which ambitious action has yet to be taken, such as the building or agriculture sector.

At the same time, the government can further strengthen existing policies across all sectors; for example, the government could extend the IRA beyond 2030, introduce coal phase-out targets for 2030, and enhance energy efficiency standards (America Is All In, 2024). Manufacturing capacity could also be strengthened, in particular for wind turbine and heat pump production (IEA, 2024a). Given that the federal government’s jurisdiction is limited some policy areas, state governments can play a significant role.

Some states, such as Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota, have recently introduced climate policies that are more ambitious than at the federal level (Joselow & Montalbano, 2023). To advance climate action at the subnational level, state governments can adopt of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and introduce sales targets for EVs.

Despite the IRA’s remarkable measures to support clean energy and address climate change, the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The concessions are described in the Power section.


## Power

Electricity supply contributed to 25% of total US GHG emissions in 2022 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). Total annual emissions in the power sector have declined steadily since 2010, mainly driven by a shift from coal to lower or non-emitting generation sources, such as fossil gas and renewables.

Electricity production from renewables overtook production from coal and nuclear power for the first time in 2022, making renewables the country’s second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j). Preliminary figures for 2023 suggest that coal is now becoming the least relevant generation source in the US, when all types of renewables are counted together (Rhodium Group, 2024)

Following a drop in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions in the power sector returned to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovered, but began dropping again in 2023. In 2021, electricity generation and emissions from coal-fired power plants increased for the first time since 2014 by 16% and 15%, respectively (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). The marked increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, and its sustained elevated level in 2022, can be mainly attributed to the significantly higher and more volatile prices of fossil gas as a consequence of the 2021 energy crisis, which rendered coal more competitive (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021b, 2023n).

In 2023, gas generation rebounded and replaced coal generation, which led to emissions reductions in the sector. Although renewables contributed to sectoral emissions reductions, fossil gas had more than double the growth rate of renewable generation.

The Biden Administration announced a target for the US' electricity system to become carbon-free by 2035. The CAT estimates that the full decarbonisation of the US power sector by 2035 would reduce total economy-wide emissions by about 25% below 2005 levels by 2030. The goal of a carbon-free power supply by 2035 is aligned with the Paris Agreement, based on the CAT’s primary global least-cost based benchmarks (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). The target also meets the IEA’s suggested net zero target year for advanced economies (IEA, 2021). If accompanied by ambitious electrification targets in other sectors, such as 100% electric vehicle (EV) sales by 2030 or the full electrification of building heating, the US would be on track to meet the target of 50%–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b).

However, emissions in the power sector must reduce more rapidly to reach the US economy-wide target. In 2021, total emissions from electricity generation had decreased by 36% compared to 2005 levels. With the introduction of the IRA, emissions from electricity generation are projected to further decrease by 67%–87% compared to 2005 levels by 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b). More recent analysis, which takes into account the recent EPA regulations in the power sector, suggests that emissions might be even further reduced to 90% below 2005 levels by 2035 (King, Kolus, et al., 2024).

Nevertheless, there remains a gap between the projections and target, highlighting the need for additional, more ambitious policies and actions.

In 2022, electricity generation from renewable sources surpassed generation from coal and nuclear power for the first time, becoming the second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j).

Increasingly cost-competitive renewables, in combination with the IRA and state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS), are expected to continue driving the growth of renewables in the electricity sector, further displacing nuclear and fossil fuel-fired power plants.

In 2023, renewables generated approximately 22% of total US electricity, with wind (10%), hydropower (6%), and solar (3%) representing the greatest shares. In 2022, solar and wind capacity increased by 5% above 2021 levels, growing to more than 238 GW. Nearly 75% of added generation capacity in 2022 were renewables. The installed capacity of solar increased by roughly 20 GW in 2023 and is projected to increase by 36 GW in 2024. The annual expansion of wind capacity lags behind solar; wind capacity only grew by 6 GW in 2023 and is forecast to increase by 7 GW in 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e).

Modelling of the IRA’s impact on renewables suggests an average capacity deployment of 54 GW/year, driven mainly by the expansion of wind and solar (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

However, according to scenarios that model a 100% clean energy power sector by 2035, annual additions in renewable energy capacity need to increase significantly. To achieve 100% renewable energy generation by 2035, the installed capacity of wind would need to grow by 70–145 GW/year between 2025 and 2035. During the same period, the installed capacity of solar would need to increase by 43–90 GW/year (Denholm et al., 2022).

The clean energy project pipeline, that is emerging as a result of the IRA, shows promising growth, having reached 309 GW of announced clean energy capacity (Cleanpower, 2024). The growth in clean energy projects is also reflected in the total project capacity seeking transmission access: in total, 1,480 GW of clean electricity generation are seeking transmission access, of which solar alone accounts for 1,086 GW (WRI, 2024).

Historically only about 14% of announced capacity gets interconnected, but the number of new projects that were announced after the passage of the IRA (e.g. more than 500 GW of solar) reflect increased developer interest and may result in a higher interconnection rate. However, major challenges for the deployment of renewables persist; complex permitting processes, higher interest rates and costs, and supply chain issues will need to be overcome to ensure project implementation (WRI, 2024).

The IRA is strengthening value chains in the medium to long term in the US by incentivising domestic manufacturing (see above), but current supply chain issues remain. While issues plaguing the solar supply chain have largely been resolved, other decarbonisation-critical equipment, such as transformers, are subject to enduring supply chain issues, resulting in long lead times (WRI, 2024).

Heightened interest rates have increased project costs, especially for renewables with high upfront costs, and have elevated prices for power purchase agreement (PPA). In turn, higher PPA prices have reduced clean energy purchases by corporates (WRI, 2024). To address risks that lead to and are associated with higher interest rates, the IRA allocates USD 3.6bn for clean energy loans to enable USD 40bn in loan guarantees, particularly targeting new technologies (Harper et al., 2023). Other instruments, such as contracts for difference, which the EU recommends to its Member States in its market design directive (European Commission, 2023), could help minimise risks and thus financing costs, especially for offshore wind (Beiter et al., 2024).

Expanding transmission lines is a major enabler for the deployment of renewables, especially wind and solar, and is essential for their overtaking of fossil gas as the primary source of electricity generation. The historical pace of grid extension of about 1% per year needs to increase to 2.3% per year to reach the full reduction potential of the IRA; a net zero pathway would require an even faster expansion (Jenkins et al., 2022). Currently, only 10% of the necessary investment in transmission infrastructure is planned (WRI, 2024).

This low level of investment is especially alarming given that transmission projects in the US take an average of 10 years to build (WRI, 2023). Although state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining and upgrading grid infrastructure, federal agencies are implementing several measures to augment investment. For instance, the US Department of Energy (DOE) introduced the Coordinated Interagency Authorizations and Permits programme (CITAP), which streamlines the permitting process for transmission facilities. The DOE also unlocked additional targeted funding to expand transmission capacity (S&P Global, 2024) and is in the process of developing auxiliary measures (WRI, 2024).

Another challenge for the power sector is the growing demand for electricity. The growth in demand is not only driven by the electrification needs of a decarbonised future, but also by the emergence of large-scale data centres, the increase in manufacturing facilities, the enhanced demand for building cooling and heating, and the introduction of hydrogen fuel plants. For example, electricity demand from data centres, which currently account for around 4% of electricity demand, is expected to grow to between 4.6%–9.1% of electricity demand by 2030 (EPRI, 2024).

Permitting and siting are major barriers for the buildout of renewable energy capacity. Current project build times average four years. The IRA includes USD 1bn to support the Biden Administration's Permitting Action Plan, which seeks to accelerate the federal permitting and environmental review process for transmission lines and clean energy productions. The federal government is also working to address issues related to project siting. The government set a target to double clean energy permits on public lands in order to reach 25 GW of renewable energy generation by 2025. This goal was reached at the end of 2023, with a total of 29 GW worth of allocated permits. A further 32 GW are currently under consideration by the government (Reuters, 2024).

Given that permitting and siting processes are largely controlled by subnational jurisdictions, action at the state level is key. California and Massachusetts have implemented promising approaches for streamlining the permitting process for clean energy projects that could be replicated by other states (WRI, 2023).

The US Department of the Interior (DOI) announced a plan to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and unlocked USD 3bn in federal loans for offshore wind and transmission projects. By the end of FY2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management aims to approve a cumulative 14.8 GW in offshore wind energy capacity to support the 2030 target (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023a). However, estimates suggest that only 14.5 GW will come online by 2030, which means the government will fall significantly short of its 30 GW target. Approximately 11 GW of planned offshore capacity have been cancelled or are being renegotiated (Canary Media, 2023).

A diverse set of drivers have been responsible for the growth of renewable energy in the US. At the subnational level, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and clean energy standards (CES) have been major drivers. In total, 32 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), accounting for 58% of US electricity sales, have enacted RPS or CES legislation. Of these, 15 states and D.C. have signed 100% clean electricity goals into legislation, while seven states have enacted such a target through state-level executive orders (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023c).

In the past, roughly half of the growth in renewable generation capacity could be associated with these standards. In recent years, however, these standards have contributed less; with current RPS or CES legislation alone the share of non-hydro RE will only increase to 28% by 2050, well below what is needed (see below).

Voluntary utility procurements, net metered PV/onsite production, and corporate PPAs have become drivers for the development of renewable energy sources (Barbose, 2023). However, these drivers are constrained by high interest rates. To ensure that sufficient renewable generation capacity is built, states could increase the ambition of their RPS or CES legislation, while states without such standards could introduce them.

At the federal level, tax credits for the production and investment in clean energy support the buildout of renewables**.** The Biden Administration modified and extended the current Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit through 2024. After 2024, the credits transition towards technology-neutral, emissions-based credits in the form of the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Energy Investment Tax Credit.

Importantly, the current tax credit applies to all projects that commence construction by 2032, providing additional investor certainty (Harper et al., 2023). Both credits incentivise investment in disadvantaged communities and provide additional bonuses to wind and solar projects in low-income neighbourhoods (The White House, 2023c). The direct impact of these credits is uncertain and difficult to assess as they overlap, complement, and engage with other incentive schemes and market dynamics.

An EPA review of scenarios estimating the IRA’s impact, which this assessment uses for the current policy projections scenario, shows that the implementation of the IRA could lead to emission reductions of between 49%–83% in the power sector by 2030 below 2005 levels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d). The modelling projects that the share of renewables in total electricity generation will increase significantly, reaching 28%–60% in 2030 and amounting to up to 85% in 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

However, these penetration levels are insufficient to meet the Biden Administration’s 2035 goal of a carbon-free power sector. In order to be aligned with a Paris Agreement-compatible, least-cost pathway, the CAT estimates that 68%–86% of the electricity generated by 2030 should come from renewable sources (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

With an increasing share of variable renewable energy in the US electricity generation mix, there is an increasing need for supply and demand-side flexibility. Storage needs will increase as gas-fired power plants, currently providing flexibility services, are phased out.

To decarbonise the power sector by 2035, approximately 120–350 GW of diurnal storage and up to 680 GW of seasonal storage is required (in a scenario that does not include carbon capture and storage (CCS)) (Harper et al., 2023). The need for utility storage and demand flexibility is also directly linked to the buildout of the transmission grid which, as highlighted above, is happening far too slowly. Building out storage capacity can reduce the need for transmission expansion and vice versa.

The IRA has spurred a significant increase in utility-scale diurnal storage projects, as evidenced by the number of storage projects awaiting interconnection. Since August 2022, more than 540 GW of storage has requested interconnection. Approximately half of that storage capacity is combined with a generation technology, mainly solar. In total, around 514 GW of storage is planned to come online before the end of 2026.

Historically, only 11% of planned storage capacity has materialised. However, the operationalisation rate might increase given that the IRA makes available the Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits for standalone storage projects. In the current storage project pipeline, battery storage dominates. The number of other storage technologies in the pipeline, notably those better suited for seasonal storage, has also increased.

In contrast to supply flexibility, demand flexibility remains underdeveloped in the US. Demand flexibility can play an important role, as transmission projects are developing too slowly, and storage projects incur additional resource use. Economic analyses suggest that large-scale demand flexibility deployment can reduce the costs of grid extension and ancillary services by approximately USD 13bn/year, while simultaneously contributing to the integration of renewables (Bronski et al., 2015).

States are beginning to recognise the importance of demand flexibility: state level institutions, such as the California Utility Commission, are starting processes to enable “widespread demand flexibility” (California Public Utilities Commission, 2022). Nevertheless, demand flexibility continues to be largely underfunded.

Seasonal storage, or long-duration storage, is underdeveloped, but will likely be critical to decarbonising the power sector by 2035. Unlike for short-term, diurnal storage, where batteries have emerged as a promising, increasingly cost-competitive technology, seasonal storage is much less mature and requires significant investments in research and development. The DOE is beginning to support seasonal storage projects; it is providing a USD 504.4m loan guarantee for a hydrogen storage capacity in Utah and introduced the Long Duration Storage Shot that aims to decrease costs for seasonal storage by 90% within the coming decade (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023c). However, the government’s efforts must be intensified to deploy the technology at the scale and pace to achieve sectoral decarbonisation.

The US government has not set a fossil fuel phase-out target for coal or fossil gas. It did not support the coal phase-out initiative at COP26, but has taken an important step since the last CAT assessment by becoming a signatory to the Powering Past Coal Alliance.

Several states have committed to phasing out coal, but states with a major share of coal generation generally have not. The federal government also recently reframed its position on phasing out fossil fuels: since May 2024, the US refers to a “a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035" after initially calling for a “carbon pollution free” electricity sector by 2035. Such reformulation opens the door for use of abated coal (e.g. with carbon capture and storage), as well as the use of coal in sectors that are not directly related to electricity generation (GEM Wiki, 2024).

In 2023, the share of coal generation continued to decline at an even faster pace than in 2022. In 2022, approximately 20% of total US electricity generation was derived from coal. This dropped to 16% in 2023, a decrease driven by the continued buildout of fossil gas generation and the growth of renewable sources.

Elevated fossil gas prices induced a temporary increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, which did not last, as gas prices returned to 2020 levels in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024c). As a result, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants reduced from 48% to 42% (Inside Climate News, 2024); a trend that reflects the worsening economics of coal but one that could be reversed in future if coal-fired power plants are not shut down.

Approximately 30% of the US coal-fired generating capacity has been retired since 2010: no new coal-fired capacity has been installed since 2013, and more coal power plants are due to be decommissioned in the near future (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021a, 2023g, 2023k). However, the retirement of coal generation capacity has slowed in recent years and is expected to continue to slow in 2024. Although the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected 8.9 GW of coal-fired power plants to retire in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g), only 5 GW actually retired (Ember, 2024). For 2024, only 2.3 GW of coal-fired power plants are set to retire (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024d). In comparison, annual coal retirements averaged 11 GW between 2015 and 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g). The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, used as one of the reference scenarios for this assessment’s current policy projections, suggests that no new coal-fired capacity will be added in the US. In the reference case, coal-fired capacity is projected to decline by 64% to 73 GW by 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023h).

This means that a full phase-out of coal power by 2035 requires additional policy action to accelerate and reinforce market forces that, as evidenced by the last decade, are pushing coal out of the mix. According to the CAT, the US needs to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2030 to be aligned with the Paris Agreement (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets existing coal-fired power plants and new gas-fired power plants. The standards cover GHG emissions, waste water, mercury, and toxic metals. The standards set the most stringent emissions limits for both plant types in US history and mandate that all coal-fired power plants reduce or capture nearly all of their CO2 emissions by 2040 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The regulation exempts coal-fired plants that are set to retire before 2032, while relaxing the standards for those retiring between 2032 and 2039; these plants need to reduce emissions by only 16%. Coal plants that operate beyond 2039 will be required to reduce their emissions intensity by implementing CCS technology to capture 90% of CO2 emissions by 2032. These requirements are expected to accelerate coal plant retirements before the 2040 deadline, resulting in an additional 22 GW of coal-fired capacity going offline between 2023 and 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The EPA’s emissions standards for fossil gas distinguish between baseload and peak power plants: the standards only apply to baseload plants larger than 300MW. Plants covered by the regulation have the option to capture 90% of emitted CO2 using CCS by 2035 or transition to 96% hydrogen fuel use by 2038. These standards are projected to reduce fossil gas emissions by approximately 200–400 MtCO2e by the mid-2040s. The combined cumulative reductions for both coal and fossil gas are forecasted to amount to 600 MtCO2e by 2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023h). While setting emissions limits for power plants is a step in the right direction, the regulation’s impact remains uncertain as smaller baseload plants and peak power plants are not covered.

The new EPA standards aim to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuel-fired power plants and explicitly allows for CCS, signalling that the government considers CCS a viable solution for emissions reductions in the mid to long term (Parenteau, 2024). However, CCS has yet to be proven commercially viable at scale, and it remains unclear whether the technology will have demonstrated commercial viability by 2040. Given the high cost of CCS applications for fossil fuel-fired power plants (Clarke et al., 2022), the CAT estimates that most fossil fuel-fired power plants that are subject to the proposed regulations will already cease operations by 2040.

If instead CCS does get deployed at scale, the widespread adoption of CCS could lead to significant additional emissions since current CCS technology only captures 90% of power plant emissions.

In the past, the EPA has met numerous legal challenges in its efforts to regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants; notable are two failed attempts during the Obama and Trump Administrations. Most recently, in June 2022, the US Supreme Court ruled to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants (West Virginia v. EPA, 2022). The decision sets a worrying precedent for future climate action. However, experts suggest the design of the EPA’s most recent standards explicitly considers the weaknesses of previously proposed regulations and, therefore, gives the standards a better chance against legal challenges (Parenteau, 2024).

In parallel, the government passed stricter standards for power plants whose pollution crosses state lines (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e). The EPA has also proposed stronger limits for mercury and water pollution from coal-fired power plants. These rules do not target pollution that directly contributes to global warming, but, nevertheless, limit the operation of coal-fired power plants and, in doing so, could indirectly accelerate their phase-out (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023g, 2023j).

Unlike coal generation, oil and fossil gas generation increased significantly in 2023. More than 10GW of fossil gas-fired power plants were added in 2023, the highest increase since 2003 (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Generation from fossil gas grew more than twice as fast as generation from renewables in 2023 (Rhodium Group, 2024).

Studies suggest that lifetime use for fossil gas-fired plants breaks even after 9–17 years of operation under current regimes. The longevity of gas-fired power plants severely hampers the phase-out of fossil gas and, as a result, either jeopardises the sector’s 2035 decarbonisation target or invites the widespread deployment of CCS if the gas-fired fleet remains in operation or is expanded (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

The US became the world’s largest producer of crude oil in 2018 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2018), reaching its highest levels of oil and gas production and exports in 2023. US crude oil exports reached a high of 4.1 million barrels per day in 2023, corresponding to a 13% increase compared to previous record export level in 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024b). Increasing exports were driven by increased crude oil production, several releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and increased demand in Europe for an alternative to Russian crude oil (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023l).

Exports of petroleum products similarly increased: more petroleum products were exported—nearly six million barrels per day—in the first half of 2023 than in the first half of any prior year. Since 2020, growth in propane exports has driven growth in overall petroleum product exports; approximately 1.5 million barrels were exported per day in the first half of 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023e).

The US is also the largest producer of fossil gas. Liquified natural gas (LNG) exports continue to increase year after year. In the first half of 2022, the US became the world’s largest LNG exporter. By the first half of 2023, LNG exports had further increased by 4% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023d). This trend is expected to continue into the future as the US is planning to increase its LNG export capacity by more than 40% by 2026, compared to 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The growth in exports is mainly driven by strong LNG demand from Europe, as well as by expanded and reopened LNG capacity. In 2022, US LNG exports to Europe increased by 141% compared to 2021 levels (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023b). Outside of Europe, interest in and demand for US LNG is also growing. In Mexico, new LNG terminals, as well as an expanding pipeline network, are contributing to growth in LNG imports from the US. In Asia, imports from the US continue to increase; Japan, China, and India increased imports in 2023 relative to 2022, while the Philippines and Vietnam imported LNG from the US for the first time in 2023 (Zaretskaya, 2024).

In January 2024, the Biden Administration took a step towards addressing the climate impacts of US fossil fuel exports by issuing a temporary pause on the development of new LNG export terminals (Daly, 2024). The administration cited outdated project evaluation criteria, which inadequately capture the financial and environmental cost of new LNG infrastructure, as cause for the moratorium. As of October 2024, the pause remains in place. It is important to note that the pause does not impact operational, as well as approved, LNG terminals and, as a result, does not immediately impact the US supply of LNG to Europe and Asia (The White House, 2024b).

Although a step in the right direction, the US should take stronger, more consistent action to phase out fossil fuel production and exportation. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest GHG emitters and richest countries in the world, the US has a responsibility and is well-positioned to phase out fossil fuels.

On the international stage, the US has signalled support for a reduction in fossil fuel production: at COP26, the US pledged to end international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022 (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021b), and at COP27, the US supported language on a “fossil fuel phasedown." However, as evidenced by ever increasing domestic oil and gas exploitation, the government has contradicted itself on this issue (CAT, 2023).

Record levels of fossil fuel production translate to record profits for oil and gas corporations. An analysis of five major fossil fuel corporations revealed that this set of companies earned USD 152bn in profit between 2017 and 2020 (Climate Power, 2024a). More recent data for 2021 through 2023 show that profits for the top ten largest oil and gas corporations by value tripled to USD 313bn under the Biden Administration in comparison to reported profits from 2017 through 2019 (McCormick & Smyth, 2024).

The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, included in the range of our current policy scenario projections, projects US fossil gas production to increase by 15% and LNG exports to increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a). This increase is due to the expected increase in domestic and foreign demand for fossil gas and a continued increase in LNG capacity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The US has one of the largest expansion plans for oil and gas projects in the world. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. With 22 oil and gas mega-project plans in place, the US accounts for more than one-fifth of potential emissions from major carbon emitting energy projects in the world. Together, these 22 mega-projects have the potential to emit nearly 143 GtCO2e in their lifetime, which is almost four times more than the entire world emits each year (Kühne et al., 2022).

Expansion of oil and gas projects is driven by planned increases in fracking and LNG extraction (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023). In 2022, subsidies for fossil fuels, as defined as budgetary transfers, tax expenditures, and general supply- and demand-side financial support, reached their highest level since 2010: subsidies amounted to USD 14bn in 2022 (Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker, 2022).

Fossil fuel subsidies have and will continue to spur the expansion of fossil fuel projects. Research indicates that two of the largest and longest standing subsidies—the ‘expensing of intangible drilling costs’ (IDC) subsidy and the ‘percentage depletion’ subsidy—increased the expected value of new oil and gas projects by upwards of USD 20bn over the past two decades (Erickson, 2021). Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which incentivises the build out of renewable energy, simultaneously enables the expansion of oil and gas production by mandating new leases on public lands for fossil fuel projects (see below on new auctions and project approvals) (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023).

To keep 1.5°C of warming within reach, GHG emissions must be halved globally by 2030 and no new oil and gas should be developed (IEA, 2023b; IPCC, 2022). Therefore, the planned investment in and development of new oil and gas infrastructure in the US obstructs progress towards the global 1.5°C temperature target, as well as the country’s 2030 climate target and 2050 net zero target, and will likely lead to significant stranded assets in a Paris Agreement-compatible future.

Beyond the IRA’s incentives for clean energy production and investment, the act also provides notable concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The act offers these compromises under the pretence of allowing domestic oil and gas companies to transition away from fossil fuels at a reasonable pace.

The IRA requires the federal government to offer an annual minimum area of specified public lands for oil and gas drilling. While the act does increase the royalty rates paid by companies for extracting fossil fuels on public lands, it also requires the prioritisation of oil and gas auctions over renewable energy on federal lands and offshore developments.

These provisions not only contradict President Biden’s promise to end new federal fossil fuel leasing of public lands, but also increase the risk of locking in fossil fuel infrastructure and creating stranded assets during the energy transition. Although the Biden Administration has already reached its 2025 target for renewable energy deployment on public lands (Groom, 2024), the continued leasing of public lands for oil and gas extraction sends a long-term signal to the fossil fuel industry that may slow the pace of emissions reductions.

The result of new fossil fuel leasing under the IRA has been the approval of several large oil and gas projects on public lands. In March 2023, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) gave its formal approval for the ConocoPhillips Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, which is the largest approved oil and gas project in the country (Chu, 2024). Although the DOI significantly reduced the scope of the project, the Willow Project is one of the few oil projects that the Biden Administration approved without a congressional or court mandate (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023b).

The approval of the project breaks Biden’s promise to stop new oil drilling on federal land and will result in significant environmental and biodiversity impacts. The project has the potential to produce over 600 million barrels of crude oil over the next 30 years, which will release nearly 280 MtCO2e in emissions (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 2023).

In 2023, the Biden Administration auctioned off 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, more than double the size of the Willow Project, for offshore oil and gas drilling. The auction generated over USD 260m, the highest bid total since 2017. While the auctioning of these offshore sites was a mandatory provision under the IRA, the government had the ability to reduce the size and scope of the sale but chose not to (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023).

In July 2023, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline to proceed. The pipeline is a 500-km-long project that will transport fossil gas from West Virginia to Virginia. The pipeline was subject to multiple lawsuits and a complex environmental permitting process as the planned pipeline will cross waterways and national forest lands. The project’s approval came after a bipartisan group of lawmakers filed an emergency request to include the project in the debt ceiling negotiations, which eliminated the ability to challenge the pipeline in court (AP News, 2023; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2023).

In September 2023, the government published new, stricter rules for offshore oil and gas leasing as part of the next iteration of its offshore leasing programme for 2024–2029 (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023). During this five-year period, only three areas of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned to fossil fuel companies. The drafting of the updated leasing programme was delayed by litigation from several states, oil and gas companies, and environmental groups (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2022).

California is the only oil and gas producing state that has moved to end production. The state banned new fracking permits from 2024 and plans to phase out oil production by 2045. California is a founding associate member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which was introduced at COP26. Washington state joined BOGA at COP27 in 2022 and has implemented measures to ban new fossil infrastructure, including oil refineries (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021, 2022). The US did not join BOGA at its founding at COP26 and has since not joined the alliance.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes a USD 21bn investment to plug and clean up abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells, which continue to emit significant amounts of methane and other pollutants long after remission (U.S. Senate, 2021). In August 2022, the DOI awarded USD 560m to 24 states to begin work on monitoring and capping methane emissions from orphaned oil and gas wells (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2022). This initiative is further supported through the IRA’s Methane Emissions Reductions Program, under which the Biden Administration announced an additional USD 350m in the first of a series of grants for states to measure and reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The programme includes funding for plugging and cleaning up abandoned well sites (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022f).


## Industry

Direct GHG emissions from industry accounted for 23% of total US emissions in 2023, making it the third largest contributor to US GHG emissions after the transport and electricity sectors.

In 2020, emissions from the industrial sector decreased by 6% due the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, sectoral emissions increased by 1% as a result of the economy’s recovery. In 2022, emissions remained stable, indicating that the sector’s emissions have not reached pre-pandemic levels again (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n).

Industrial emissions have remained largely stable over the past decade, even as the US economy has transitioned from a manufacturing to a service-based economy and as industrial processes have experienced efficiency improvements and shifted to less emissions-intensive fuels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n). Under current policies, emissions from the industrial sector are projected to remain stable or minimally decrease as a result of the counteracting forces of renewed growth in domestic manufacturing and strengthen decarbonisation policies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (King, Kolus, et al., 2024; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA funds several measures to decarbonise the industrial sector. The act provides USD 5.8bn in funding for the new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. In 2024, this programme selected, and began awarding financing to, projects in emissions-intensive industrial facilities (e.g. iron, steel, concrete sectors). The DOE estimates that the programme will reduce 14 MtCO2 annually (Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, 2024).

The IRA also expands tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and sequestration (CCUS) technology, building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s (BIL) investments in CCUS demonstrations and industrial applications (The White House, 2023b; U.S. Department of Energy, 2022d). Estimates suggest that measures under the IRA for industrial CCUS might reduce up to 240MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA includes the Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides tax credits for industrial and manufacturing facilities that invest in certain clean energy technologies. Eligible facilities either must re-tool with equipment designed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20%, re-equip, expand, or establish measures for producing and recycling clean energy equipment, or process, refine, and recycle critical materials (The White House, 2023b). A total of USD 10bn in tax credits was allocated in a first round. A second round in 2024 aims to allocate an additional USD 6bn (IRS, 2024; U.S. Department of Energy, 2024g).

The US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development of technologies that are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.

The challenging economics of many technologies in the industrial sector, such as green hydrogen and CCUS, require clear, robust incentive schemes to de-risk and attract investment (Department of Energy, 2024). Individual products, such as clean and/or green steel, might otherwise still find niche market applications (e.g. via government procurement), but will likely not be sufficiently commercialised to enable a full sector decarbonisation.

In March 2023, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalised its Good Neighbour Plan, which requires industrial facilities and power plants in 23 states to cut NOx emissions to prevent pollution across state lines. By 2026, the EPA plans to set enforceable NOx emissions control requirements, which will primarily reduce emissions from harmful air pollutants and also reduce CO2 emissions by 16 MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

In December 2020, the US Congress enacted legislation under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act to tackle hydrofluorocarbon emissions (HFC). The act directs the EPA to phase down the production and imports of HFCs by 85% until 2036. It is expected to reduce emissions by 4.7 GtCO2e by 2050 via sector-based requirements to transition to non-HFC-emitting alternatives and next-generation technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b).

In 2024, the US met its HFC phase-down target of reducing HFCs by 40% below 2020 levels (Haroldsen, 2024). The IRA provides an additional USD 38.5m to the EPA to implement the AIM Act (The White House, 2023b). We incorporate the IRA's effects on reducing non-CO2 emissions into our current policy projections through a review of studies that quantify this impact (see Assumptions section).

Hydrogen plays a central role in the Biden Administration’s roadmap for decarbonising hard-to-abate industrial processes and replacing fossil fuel-based feedstock with cleaner alternatives. The IRA established the Hydrogen Production Tax Credit to incentivise domestic production of clean hydrogen and to meet the Biden Administration’s Hydrogen Shot target, which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to USD 1 per kilogram through 2030 (The White House, 2023b). Recently, the credit has received criticism for its requirements to minimise emissions from hydrogen production, which certain actors argue are too costly (Pontecorvo, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, the transport sector accounted for 28.5% of total US GHG emissions and, since 2017, has been the largest contributor. Total sector emissions increased by 19.4% between 1990 and 2022 due to increased motorised transport demand: during the same period, the average number of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) per passenger cars and light-duty trucks increased by 46.7%. Road transport is responsible for the vast majority of transport sector emissions in the US: light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks and passenger cars accounted for 79.8% of total sectoral emissions in 2022 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes several components to decarbonise the transport sector, such as investments to improve roads, modernise public transit, and boost the electric vehicle (EV) market (U.S. Senate, 2021). The BIL includes measures to develop EV charging stations (USD 7.5 bn), strengthen the country’s EV battery supply chain (USD 7bn), update and upgrade public transportation (USD 39bn), build out ‘climate-friendly’ passenger and freight railways (USD 66bn), and invest in roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure projects (USD 110bn), as well as in clean busses and ferries (USD 7.5bn).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), alongside significant investments in electrifying light- and heavy-duty vehicles (see below), provides considerable financial support for EV manufacturing and supply chains: the IRA sets aside USD 2bn for the Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant Program, which funds the re-tooling of production lines for EVs. The act allocates another USD 3bn for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which has expanded coverage to heavy-duty vehicles, locomotives, maritime vessels, and planes. As a result, plans for 163 new battery and 117 EV manufacturing plants have been announced.

If fully realised, these plants would create over 170,000 new jobs in battery and EV manufacturing and account for over 60% of all new jobs created by the IRA (Climate Power, 2024b). By 2030, if all planned manufacturing plants are operationalised, domestic battery manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by nearly 20 times to approximately 1000 GWh/year relative to 55 GWh/year in 2021 (U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2023).

The IRA also extends the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit to spur the domestic production and sale of clean energy components, including certain EV-relevant battery components and critical minerals (The White House, 2023b). Through these measures, the IRA is expected to reduce transport sector emissions by 15%–35% by 2035 relative to 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). In combination with existing policies and the BIL, the IRA is estimated to reduce overall GHG emissions by 1,150 MtCO2e in 2030 in comparison to business-as-usual scenarios; the result is that GHG emissions are forecasted to be 40% lower in 2030 than in 2005 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022e).

In January 2023, the Biden Administration released its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation to support the 2050 economy-wide net zero target and the 2050 target of 80%–100% emissions reductions in the transport sector. The blueprint's three key strategies align with the Avoid, Shift, and Improve (ASI) framework: the strategy supports community design and land-use planning, expands access to more efficient public and private transport, and facilitates the transition to zero emission vehicles and fuels (U.S. Department of Energy et al., 2023).

The modal split for passenger transport has been and continues to be dominated by road transport. In 2022, nearly 70% of all commutes were undertaken by single-occupancy vehicles, while only approximately 9% of commuters carpooled. The share of single-occupancy vehicle commutes decreased by over 10% between 2018 to 2022. During the same period, and likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of the population working from home increased by nearly 10%. In 2022, approximately 6% of commuters used public transport and engaged active mobility (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2022).

In March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised its Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles. The standards, which will phase in from 2027 through 2032, set fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets for auto manufacturers. For light-duty vehicles, the fleet-wide average target is 170 CO2 grams/mile in 2027. By 2032, the average target for light-duty fleets will be reduced to 85 CO2 grams/mile (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i).

To meet the 2032 target, the EPA estimates that battery electric vehicles will account for 30–56% of automaker's fleets to meet the average emissions target (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024j). The resulting emissions reductions are approximated to total 7.2bn tons of CO2 through 2055 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024b).

The efforts are somewhat undermined by the fact that medium-duty vehicles—a vehicle segment that includes vans and pickup trucks and represented nearly 20% of the total US light- and medium-duty vehicle fleet in 2021—are subject to a different, less demanding set of emission standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a).

Although the updated standards are the most stringent in US history, the standards are less ambitious than equivalent regulations in the EU and the UK, where the emissions target for 2035 is 0 CO2 grams/mile for new light-duty vehicles (The International Council on Clean Transportation, 2024). The relative weakness of the US standards may be partially attributable to lobbying efforts from auto manufacturers. The EPA initially proposed more ambitious fleet-wide average targets between 2027 and 2032, but the auto lobby, spearheaded by Toyota's push for more flexibility in achieving the emissions targets, successfully watered down the standards (Tabuchi, 2024). In doing so, auto manufacturers can continue to fulfil their emission reduction targets with ICE-based vehicles, which prolongs the production and profitability of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and obstructs a faster transition towards a decarbonised transport sector.

At the state level, stricter, more ambitious EV policy has been implemented. California established a 100% EV sales target for 2035 through its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation in 2023. This regulation has been duplicated and adopted by twelve other states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) (California Air Resources Board, 2024). As a result, over one-third of all light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales in the US are subject to the 2035 100% EV sales target (IEA, 2024b).

The combined sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles made up 16.3% of all new LDV sales in the US in 2023. Battery electric vehicles accounted for approximately 7% of new car sales in the US in 2023; BEV sales reached a record of 1.1 million in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a).

The growth in BEV sales is the result of a larger selection and significant price cuts in vehicles: in 2023, 20 new BEV models were introduced, while the average transaction price for BEVs decreased by over 17% between December 2022 and December 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the gap in average transaction price between BEVs and ICE-based vehicles decreased to a record low of USD 7,000 before any purchase incentives are applied (Doll, 2024; Kelley Blue Book, 2023; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a). This means that, once government incentives are applied, certain BEVs are as or more affordable than their ICE counterparts. Beyond increases in availability and affordability, growing consumer interest and IRA incentives continue to further augmented uptake (Inside EVs, 2023).

To reduce emissions from road transport, the government set a goal for 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles (The White House, 2021d). However, this 50% target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement. To be compatible with the PA, research suggests that 95–100% of sales of new LDVs in the US should be zero-emissions by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).

Even with IRA support, the US government estimates that LDV EV sales will only reach a median of 36% in 2030 (with a range of 15%–54%) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c), which is insufficient to meet the Biden Administration's goal, let alone to meet the 1.5°C compatible benchmark (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

It is important to note that estimates for EV uptake vary substantially. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2023 estimates that the US will achieve the EV sales target of 50% by 2030 under the STEPS scenario and the International Council on Clean Transportation anticipates the LDV EV sales share will reach 48%–61% in 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). At the same time, recent US Energy Information Agency (EIA) calculations only project 13–29% EV sales in 2050 (IEA, 2023a; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023i).

The US did not sign the 100% EVs declaration at COP26. Signatories agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles (Race to Zero, 2021). Despite the absence of the federal government’s signature, many US subnational and non-state actors, including states, cities, and automakers, signed the declaration (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021a).

In March 2024, the Biden Administration, building on the set of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration in 2018, increased tariffs on a range of decarbonisation-relevant products and technologies from China. Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles increased the most: the border tax on EVs will quadruple from 25% to 100% of the import value (Tankersley & Rappeport, 2024). Although politically significant, research indicates that economic impacts will likely be limited (Sherman, 2024). In September 2024, the Biden Adminsitration, citing national security concerns, proposed a ban on all Chinese connected car hardware and software (Shepardson et al., 2024). If finalised, Chinese software would be banned starting in 2026, while hardware would be prohibited beginning in 2030.

The IRA accelerates the uptake of electric light-duty vehicles by extending and expanding tax credits for both new and used EVs. From 2023 through 2032, the Clean Vehicle Credit provides up to USD 7,500 for new battery electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell EVs that retail under USD 80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and USD 55,000 for all other types of vehicles. To qualify for the full credit, the vehicle and its critical mineral and battery components must meet certain requirements for assembly in and sourcing from North America or trusted trade partners (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024a). The result of the sourcing and manufacturing requirements is that only 22 EV models qualified for the total tax credit out of the 104 EV models for sale in May 2024 (Lambert, 2024).

Beyond targeting new EV sales, the US government seeks to leverage the maturing used electric vehicle market, which was made up of approximately 400,000 EVs in 2023 (IEA, 2024b): the Used Clean Vehicles Credit provides up to USD 4,000 to buyers who purchase a used electric vehicle for USD 25,000 or less (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024c).

Both the credits for new and used EVs are capped at different income levels to increase the affordability of and access to EVs for individuals and households with lower to middle incomes. Buyers of used EVs can also claim the credit at the time of purchase, which more immediately reduces the purchasing or monthly financing cost. As high costs remain a crucial barrier to EV adoption, reducing costs, particularly for buyers with lower incomes, accelerates and supports a just transition to EVs (Pamidimukkala et al., 2023).

The government is on track to achieve its 2030 target for 500,000 publicly accessible recharging points in 2026 (The White House, 2024a). The number of publicly accessible recharging points increased by over 70% to 170,000 stations since 2021 (U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, 2024).(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023i)

Freight transport emissions account for an increasing share of total transport emissions in the US: the share of emissions from freight transport increased from 24% in 1990 to 32% in 2021 (K. Kennedy, 2023). Trucking accounted for 65% of all freight moved by weight and made up roughly 83% of total freight transport emissions in 2021 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024f).

To mitigate emissions from trucking, the government revised emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2024 (see below). Shifting freight transport to rail, which only emitted 5.7% of total sectoral emissions in 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2023) and accounted for the greatest share of long-distance freight volumes across all modes of freight transport, has significant emissions reductions potential (Association of American Railroads, 2021).

In March 2024, the EPA adopted an updated set of vehicle emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, transit, and vocational vehicles. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles Phase 3 strengths the existing emissions standards: heavy-duty vocational vehicles need to reduce emissions by up to 60% more under the Phase 3 standards relative to Phase 2.

The revised standards will effect HDVs starting in 2027 through 2032. Between 2027 and 2055, the standards are expected to mitigate approximately 1bn tons of CO2 emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024e). In comparison, the EU, which also revised its heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards in 2024, sets a more ambitious emissions reductions target for all new HDVs for 2030, which will escalate to a 90% target for 2040.

As a first step to mainstream reductions in freight transport emissions, the Biden Administration established a national goal to transition towards a zero-emissions freight sector in April 2024. Although the administration has not indicated an explicit timeline for the zero-emissions target, separate action plans for decarbonising truck, rail, aviation, and marine freight transport are to be developed.

Since its adoption in 2022, the IRA has spurred investments and introduced provisions to reduce GHG emissions from heavy-duty transport. Through the IRA, the EPA launched the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle Program, which was revised in 2024, to provide USD 1bn in grants to states, municipalities, and Tribes to offset the costs of replacing heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emissions alternatives and installing related infrastructure; at least USD 400m of the total funding will be channelled towards communities suffering from severe air pollution (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024d). The programme's first funding round of over USD 900m opened in April 2024 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024c). The EPA estimates that 70% of the programmes funding will go towards replacing ICE-based school buses (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024a). An additional USD 3bn is allocated to provide grants to local governments, port authorities, and other relevant actors to purchase and install zero-emission port equipment and technology (The White House, 2023b).

The IRA has also introduced the Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, which defers 30% of the costs of replacing diesel or gas-powered commercial vehicles—ranging from cars to long-haul trucks —with electric vehicles. A credit of up to 15% is also available when replacing a vehicle with a partially electric alternative. The IRA also allocates USD 3bn for electrifying the United States Postal Service fleet (The White House, 2023b).

Beyond providing tax credits for buyers, the government is partnering with truck manufacturers to further develop heavy-duty EV technologies. Through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, the Supertruck 3 programme, and the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium, the US Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting the research and development of next generation of heavy-duty batteries and fuel cells (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022a).

The government is also funding commercial EV demonstration projects. In 2023, the DOE awarded over USD 7m to seven projects that will develop a medium- and heavy-duty recharging station corridor across 23 states. In 2024, the government announced that the DOE would fund the research and development of load management strategies to alleviate recharging-related grid capacity challenges.

Federal government support for commercial EV uptake has been supplemented by state action. New York and California provide additional purchase incentives of over USD 100,000 on top of the IRA’s mechanism. In response, adoption of heavy-duty EVs seems to be increasing: delivery van fleets are quickly electrifying as Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Walmart place major EV orders. Commercial production by Volvo and Freightliner of electric tractor trailers, or 18-wheelers, began in 2023.

Although there are promising signs of increasing implementation, only 1.5% of all commercial heavy-duty vehicles in the US were BEVs or PHEVs in September 2023. At the same point in time, the share of BEVs and PHEVs in the HDV fleets in Europe and China amounted to over 7% and 10%, respectively (Soulopoulos, 2023).

The IRA also seeks to encourage the development and adoption of sustainable fuel technologies in the aviation industry. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit incentivises the sale and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

The tax credit, worth USD 1.25 per gallon, is progressive: SAF that reduce emissions by more than 50% are eligible for an additional USD 0.01 per gallon for each extra percent that the reduction exceeds 50% (up to USD 0.50 per gallon) (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022c). The act additionally provides nearly USD 300m in grants to develop and deploy projects related to sustainable aviation fuel and low-emission aviation technologies (The White House, 2023b).

Although the US produced nearly 16m gallons of SAF in 2022, these fuels accounted for less than 0.1% of the total fuel used by US airlines in the same year (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2023). Additionally, analysis suggests that currently available SAF do not reduce emissions across the fuels’ full lifecycles given their emissions and agricultural resource-intensive production methods (Lashof & Denvir, 2024).


## Buildings

In 2022, direct GHG emissions from buildings accounted for 13.5% percent of total US GHG emissions; 7.3% of the sector’s emissions came from commercial buildings and 6.2% from residential buildings. When accounting for indirect, electricity-related emissions, the buildings sector made up almost one-third (31.1%) of the country’s total GHG emissions in 2022. Since 2005, total emissions—the combination of direct and indirect emissions—from residential and commercial buildings have decreased by approximately 25%. However, direct emissions from buildings have remained nearly constant since 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The Biden Administration aims to reduce emissions from buildings by 65% in 2035 and by 90% in 2050 compared to 2005 emissions levels. However, to be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT estimates that emissions from buildings in the US should already be 60% lower in residential buildings and 70% lower in commercial buildings by 2030 compared to 2015 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021a, 2021b). Achieving these levels of emissions reductions requires the complete phase-out of new fossil fuel-based energy supply installations in buildings and the rapid retrofitting of the existing housing stock to improve energy efficiency.

Developing and implementing building codes is largely the responsibility of state and local authorities. The federal government’s ability to regulate emissions from buildings is limited; the federal government can directly regulate federal buildings and, otherwise, can only provide financial support and technical guidance for state and local governments.

In April 2024, the US Department of Energy (DOE) released a national strategy to guide the decarbonisation of the building sector by 2050, which emphasises the federal government’s role in coordinating and supporting subnational governments in reaching this target (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a). The strategy outlines key actions, performance targets, and barriers to increase building energy efficiency, accelerate on-site emissions reductions, transform the grid edge, and minimise embodied lifecycle emissions.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes USD 225m for state and local implementation of energy codes. Albeit limited in comparison with other funding allocations under the BIL, these resources have largely gone towards the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation programme to support energy code adoption, enforcement, training, and technical assistance at the subnational level. In 2022, the DOE released a new building energy code for federal buildings that aims to improve energy efficiency (The White House, 2022b).

The Biden Administration’s National Initiative to Advance Building Codes unlocked USD 1bn in IRA grants to further support state and local governments in the adoption of the latest building codes and energy efficiency standards. The initiative aims to provide technical and financial support to state and local governments to modernise building codes in underserved communities, to enhance resilience to increasingly severe weather impacts, to increase household savings on utility bills, and, in turn, to further reduce residential GHG emissions.

In June 2024, the DOE released its National Definition for a Zero Emissions Building (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024e). According to the definition, a net zero energy building (nZEB) must be highly energy efficient, cannot emit greenhouse gases on-site, and is powered entirely by clean energy. It is important to note that this definition is not a binding, regulatory standard. Instead, the definition is intended to support and guide public and private sectors in decarbonising new and existing commercial and residential buildings.

At the state level, only California and Massachusetts have set targets for nZEBs in their building codes (Massachusetts State, 2022; State of California Public Utilities Commission, 2021). Due to its limited jurisdiction regarding building codes, the federal government has only set a net zero target for federal buildings (see federal buildings section below). In contrast, the EU, which is similarly legally constrained in implementing building codes, requires Member States to set domestic regulations for all new buildings to be zero emissions by 2030 and for the entire building stock to be zero emissions by 2050.

Given that the average lifetime of residential buildings is over 60 years (Aktas & Bilec, 2012), renovating and converting existing buildings into nZEBs is key to mitigating emissions from the sector. To encourage net zero renovations, the federal government provides financial incentives. However, the government does not clearly define or provide guidance on the process of converting buildings to net zero structures. In comparison, the EU provides a step-by-step, long-term guide for deep, net zero renovations through its Building Renovation Passport; the guidelines make the renovation process more accessible to homeowners and, in turn, expediate the transition to nZEBs (European Commision, 2024).

As it stands, the decarbonisation of buildings in the US will mainly rely on financial incentives for energy efficiency improvements, which, as a result, may have to rely heavily on the electrification of buildings and put more pressure on the power sector. Modelling work by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hints at the building sector’s dependency on electrification for decarbonisation: under the IRA, total emissions from buildings will decrease significantly by 2035 as the share of electricity in final energy consumption is expected to increase by nearly 5% between 2025 and 2035 (in contrast, to an increase of only 2% in the absence of the IRA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023a). At the same time, direct emissions from fuel combustion will likely remain stable; indicating that reductions in total emissions seem to be driven by a decrease in indirect, end-use electricity emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

Through the BIL, the government allocated USD 3bn to support energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in homes (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022g). The 2022 IRA builds on the BIL by unlocking nearly USD 9bn for states and Tribes to support consumer home energy rebate programmes; specifically, for programmes related to retrofitting buildings and purchasing high-efficiency electronic appliances in lower-income communities (The White House, 2023b).

The incentives aim to simultaneously reduce energy costs for homeowners and emissions from residential buildings. Via IRA funding, households that retrofit their homes and reduce energy use by at least 35% are eligible for a tax rebate worth USD 4,000. Multifamily structures can qualify for up to USD 400,000.

To further incentivise home energy improvements, the government provides tax rebates for energy efficiency upgrades, such as for installing heat pumps, insulation, doors, and windows, and for investing in residential clean energy, including rooftop solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024b).

Beyond supporting residential building upgrades, the IRA targets energy use in commercial buildings by providing tax deductions for buildings that increase their energy efficiency by at least 25% (The White House, 2023b). The BIL introduced the Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program (RLF), which channels USD 250m to states to establish revolving loan funds. With these funds, states can provide loans, grants, and technical assistance for energy upgrades and retrofits in commercial and residential buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022b, 2024d).

Embodied life-cycle carbon emissions of construction and building materials are a significant contributor to GHG emissions: embodied carbon is estimated to make up approximately 14% of building emissions (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a) and as much as 6% of total national emissions (Huynh et al., 2023).

However, there is a lack of standardised, high-quality data on embodied emissions and the federal government does not publicly release data on such emissions. Nevertheless, the government, under the IRA, has taken steps to reduce embodied emissions in buildings. In 2023, the IRA allocates USD 100m to develop standardised labels for lower-embodied carbon building materials, as well as USD 2.15bn for 150 construction projects that employ types of asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel with low embodied carbon (Chase, 2024).

Energy efficiency standards for consumer products and appliances in the US are generally ambitious; a 2023 review of the stringency of minimum energy performance standards determined that the federal government’s energy standards for electric motors, refrigerators, and water heaters meet or exceed international best practice (Mavandad & Malinowski, 2023).

The EPA’s voluntary energy efficiency labelling programme, ENERGY STAR, supports the government’s efficiency standards. The programme labels efficient products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and, in 2020, is estimated to have reduced emissions by 400 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to a 5% reduction in total national emissions (ENERGY STAR, 2023).

In 2022, the Biden Administration took over 100 actions to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a broad range of products, including household products and appliances, as well as commercial and industrial equipment. The updated standards will reduce GHG emissions by an estimated 2.4 GtCO2e over the next 30 years, or around 80 MtCO2e/year (The White House, 2022c).

In 2023 and 2024, the DOE finalised new standards for refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners and cleaners, and clothes washers and dryers. In combination, these new standards are expected to reduce emissions by an average of 19.9 MtCO2e/year over the next 30 years (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023b, 2023a, 2024c). In total, the revised standards for these products will reduce household and business energy costs by USD 8.7bn per year.

The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US and federal buildings are a principal source of the government’s emissions (Council on Environmental Quality, 2024). In April 2024, the DOE amended its energy performance standards for the new construction and renovation of federal buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024b). The revised standards explicitly require federal buildings to reduce the use of fossil fuels. According to the standards, federal agencies must reduce their fossil fuel use in new construction and major renovation projects by 90% between FY2025 and FY2029. The standards mandate that the on-site use of fossil fuels is eliminated by 2030 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024f).

In 2021, President Biden established through Executive Order numerous targets for federal operations and procurement, including reaching net zero emissions in the federal buildings portfolio by 2045 and reducing federal buildings emissions by 50% by 2032 (The White House, 2021c). In 2022, the Biden Administration issued implementing instructions on the Executive Order, which detailed the agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability mechanism to achieve such targets (The White House Council on Environmental Quality, 2022).


## Agriculture

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9% of US emissions in 2022. Between 1990 and 2022, agriculture emissions increased by 8%, primarily from the growth of the livestock sector and the intensification of farming practices. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils made up half of agricultural emissions. Enteric fermentation and manure management from livestock represented other significant emissions sources.

Agricultural emissions decreased in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, this decrease was not the result of new policy, but is rather attributable to the decline in herd size—the smallest since the 1960s—due to drought conditions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates USD 19.5bn for mitigation activities in the agriculture sector. The act mainly boosts the funding of existing conservation programmes, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) (Monke et al., 2022).

Both programmes offer financial and technical support to farmers to implement climate-friendly practices, including nutrient management, cover crops, low or no-tillage, and agroforestry. Historically, farmers have struggled to access funding under such programmes due to high demand and limited institutional capacity. These barriers could potentially be addressed by better distributing programme spending (e.g. by capping funds per farm), limiting the funding that goes to ineffective conservation practices, and increasing agency resources (Happ, 2023; Tham, 2023).

However, the efficacy of existing programmes to address on-farm emissions has come into question. Between 2019 and 2020, only one-fifth of total EQIP spending reportedly went towards the implementation of agricultural practices that directly reduce GHG emissions (Schechinger, 2022). While programmes like EQIP and CSP are now bolstered by IRA funding, they still face structural issues that may impede climate mitigation.

In 2024, 15 new practices were added to the 'climate-smart' category under the EQIP, but many of the new measures do not have proven climate benefits. A significant portion of EQIP funding goes towards manure management practices, including biodigesters that convert manure into biogas, which can be sold for profit and, therefore, may incentivise farmers to maintain or increase their herd sizes (Happ, 2024; Schechinger, 2024).

The IRA has also funded several programmes to support renewable energy use in the agriculture sector, including loans and grants for farmers who implement energy efficient equipment or underutilised renewable energy technologies (The White House, 2023b). However, certain provisions of these programmes could lead to perverse incentives. For instance, the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) subsidises biogas production. However, in combination with existing state subsidies for cattle farmers to produce biomass, REAP’s subsidies could lead to intensified livestock production (Sainato, 2022).

The Farm Bill is a policy that heavily influences farmers’ decisions on what food to produce and how to produce it. The 2018 bill expired last year, but was temporarily extended through FY2024. Its official renewal was pushed to 2024 since Congress could not come to an agreement on the contents of the new bill.

In 2024, the Republican-led House Committee on Agriculture released a draft bill that could deter climate progress in the agriculture sector. The bill would reallocate up to USD 14.4bn from the IRA that is specifically meant for climate-friendly farming practices to cover all conservation practices. The bill would also reinstate the requirement that 50% of EQIP funds are channelled to livestock operations (House Committee on Agriculture, 2024). However, the fate of the Farm Bill and its contents remain unclear as it has yet to arrive on the House floor.

There are still considerable policy gaps in addressing agricultural emissions. Beyond the structural issues of existing programmes (i.e. EQIP, CSP), the US lacks regulations or plans for addressing emissions from animal production. There are no incentives for reducing the volume of animal agriculture or for promoting plant-based foods and crops (CBD, 2020). Instead, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), which are detrimental to animal and environmental welfare, continue to be subsidised by the government (Happ, 2024).

The government also lacks policies on the demand-side. The US has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world, but food consumption patterns have not been addressed by the government. Historically, the meat industry has lobbied against key demand-side policies, such as changes to dietary guidelines, which constitute the basis of federal nutrition programmes and policy (Bottemiller Evich, 2016; Sebastian, 2024). Without a shift in diets, related emissions may increase by 9% in the US as a result of population growth (Heller et al., 2020).

The volume of food waste in the US is very high. Approximately one-third of available food is lost or wasted. Surplus, wasted food results in significant embodied emissions across the supply chain, and has been estimated to account for 6% of the country’s total GHG emissions (Harwood et al., 2023). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a goal to halve food loss and waste by 2030.

However, the target puts little focus on food losses, which occur during the production and processing stages, due to a lack of data (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o). The US is not on track to reach this target due to insufficient federal and state-level policies. Interventions to prevent food waste, such as policies on date labels, are insufficient. At the subnational level, some states hinder the recycling of food waste through bans on diverting food waste streams towards animal feed (ReFED, 2024).


## Forestry

In 2022, the net CO2 removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector corresponded to roughly 15% of total US GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, net carbon removals in the sector decreased by 13% due to the declining rate of net carbon accumulation in forests and on cropland, as well as an increase in emissions from urbanisation (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

Maintaining and increasing the carbon sink is an important component of the US government’s NDC and net zero targets. The government is a signatory of COP26’s forestry pledge, and the New York Declaration of Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030, improve and expanding forest finance and governance, and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Forest Declaration Platform, 2022).

Although the government has pledged to preserve and expand its natural carbon sink in its national policies and international negotiations, a recent study published by the US Forest Service raises concerns about the potential of US forests to store carbon in the long term. A decrease in forest area from land conversion, an increased demand for timber products, and a higher frequency of natural disturbances from climate change are reducing the ability of US aging forests to sequester carbon. Under a high wood demand scenario, US forests could even become a carbon source by 2070 (U.S. Forest Service, 2023).

To circumvent such risks, the US needs more robust forest management practices and policies. Current afforestation rates are insufficient to maintain current levels of CO2 removal, let alone meet the values presented in the government’s long-term strategy (LTS). Further incentives are needed to expand forest area, which is especially challenging on private lands (Wear & Wibbenmeyer, 2023).

Although afforestation has the largest potential to improve the carbon sink, more can be done to increase the average carbon stocks of managed forests, such as extending harvests or rotation ages. Increased investments in fire suppression and post-wildfire reforestation are necessary to mitigate wildfires and reduce their severity, which is exacerbated by climate change (S. Kennedy et al., 2024).

In 2020, then-President Trump reversed a long-standing rule that limited logging in the largest national forest, Alaska’s Tongass National Forest. The Biden Administration reinstated the protections on the forest in January 2023 by banning road-building and logging on the majority of the forest’s 16 million acres (Friedman, 2023). Considering that the Tongass makes up over one-fifth of the nation’s forest carbon stocks, its protection is critical to preserving the considerable US carbon sink (Dellasala et al., 2022).

The IRA has led to further investments (USD 5bn) in the National Forest Service and programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities. This includes grants for urban and community tree planting efforts, technical and financial assistance for landowners to boost carbon sequestration on forestland, and support for existing programmes (The White House, 2023b).

The Forest Legacy Program identifies and conserves environmentally significant forest areas that are threatened by land conversion through economic incentives. Landowners can either sell their property to the government or use a conservation easement. The programme has conserved over 3 million acres of forest land since 1990 (U.S. Forest Service, n.d.).

On the other hand, the IRA has introduced some tax measures that could drive biomass production and accelerate logging if inputs are not well-managed. Certain tax incentives for clean energy production and subsidies for advanced manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for carbon capture technologies, could be used by bioenergy companies to boost their production of forest biomass (e.g. wood pellets). The Treasury Department has not yet defined what ‘clean energy’ refers to under such provisions (Bruggers, 2024).

The US Forest Service has separate timber production targets that are highly misaligned with its responsibility to preserve and increase the carbon sink (Talbott, 2024). The agency wants to increase timber production by 25% above current levels, which is higher than any period in the past few decades (U.S. Forest Service, 2022).

The agency cites some of the reinstated protections on old-growth forests as a barrier to increased logging, and also identifies logging in regions critical to preserving high-carbon forests, such as the Pacific Northwest, as key to meeting the target (U.S. Forest Service, 2022)(Talbott, 2024). To reach the net LULUCF emissions removals needed to meet US climate targets, climate mitigation should be prioritised over timber production.


## Waste

The waste sector made up only 2.7% of national emissions in 2021 but contributed to 17% of anthropogenic methane emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). Therefore, addressing methane emissions from landfills is a key pillar of the US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. In 2021, the Biden Administration finalised emissions standards to ensure that large municipal landfills significantly reduce their methane emissions, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a Landfill Methane Outreach Program to support methane collection and distribution at smaller, unregulated landfills (The White House, 2021b).

The IRA has not led to significant policies or programmes in the waste sector, aside from some funding to improve methane monitoring and to develop a better method to measure fugitive methane sources (e.g. landfills) (The White House, 2023b).

Recently, the EPA has been sued by environmental groups for failing to update its landfill emissions accounting methodology, which it has not revised since 1998. The current emissions factors reportedly underestimate the emissions released from landfills from several pollutants, including nitrogen oxide, by as much as 25%. As a result of the lawsuit, the EPA has agreed to evaluate whether methodology needs updating and to suggest new emissions factors in case updating is required (Quinn, 2023).


## Methane

Methane is an important source of GHG emissions in the US, representing 15% of total GHG emissions in 2022, which are split between the oil and gas industry (37%), agriculture (36%), waste (19%), and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (8%) sectors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o).

Alongside the EU, the US spearheaded the launch of the Global Methane Pledge. The Biden Administration released its Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan in 2021. The plan seeks to reduce emissions from all major sources through regulations, financial incentives, and public-private partnerships.

The plan also includes USD 20bn in new investments targeted at reducing methane emissions (The White House, 2022a). The IRA provided USD 1.5bn for the Methane Emissions Reduction Fund, which aims to monitor and reduce emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems through financial and technical assistance, but also potentially locks in new “brown” infrastructure. It also established a ‘waste emissions charge’ per ton of methane emissions to oil and gas facilities that exceed emissions thresholds (The White House, 2023b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions are based on the 1990–2022 inventory emissions developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). The national inventory was reported in AR5 Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. We converted all values to AR4 GWP.


## NDC and other targets

For the 2030 NDC target, we apply the indicated target of 50%–52% reduction to the 2005 base year including LULUCF, and then subtract the projected emissions for the LULUCF sector. The LULUCF emission projections in 2030 were taken from the 5th Biennial Report which reported sinks of 0.6–0.8 GtCO2e/year in 2030 (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

For the net zero target, we assume total GHG emissions in 2050 are balanced by projected sinks in 2050. The LULUCF sinks in 2050 were taken from the US long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Since the document does not provide exact figures, we have extracted the approximated figures from the graphs in the report. The reading of the graphs results in an approximation of minus 0.6-1.4 GtCO2e/year for LULUCF sinks in 2050, we add this sink to the residual estimate in 2050 to get 0.6-1.5 GtCO2e/year in 2050. We include also estimates for 2040 in our pathway using a similar approach.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections were generated in five steps:

- First, we estimate the total emissions projections under current policies as the aggregation of the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors:GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical, and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.
- Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.
- Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).
- All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.
- GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical, and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).

- GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- Second, each of the above emissions categories was harmonised to historical data for each sector by applying the estimated annual percentage change from the projected dataset to the base year. The projections for all sectors were then aggregated to obtain total GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF. These projections are the baseline scenarios.
- Third, the quantification of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in non-CO2 emissions and in non-energy sectors:Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fourth, the quantification of the AIM Act, which was not part of the policies considered in the baseline scenario taken from Global Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections & Mitigation Potential:Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.
- The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target.

- The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fifth, economy wide emission projections from a 2024 study by the Rhodium Group (King, Kolus, et al., 2024) were included in the analysis as well, after deducting LULUCF sinks based on the 5th BUR. The study includes additional policies, including the impact of the EPA's emissions standards for vehicles beginning in model year 2027 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i) and the EPA's pollution standards for fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m). This study represents the lower end of the current policy projections range.

# Targets


## Target overview

In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the US has set a target to reduce emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (U.S. Government, 2021). This target covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (GHGs). The CAT assessment excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target, resulting in a 45%–50% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. The CAT rates the US domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution.

The US submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, officially committing to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).


## NDC Updates

The US submitted its current, more ambitious NDC target on 22 April 2021. President Biden moved to re-join the Paris Agreement on his first day in office in 2021. In line with its re-joining the agreement, the US submitted a strengthened NDC, in which the government commits to reducing emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF).

The CAT estimates that the target would translate to a range of 3,790–4,131 MtCO2e absolute GHG emissions in 2030, excluding LULUCF (or 45%–50% below 2005 levels), depending on whether the sink from LULUCF is at the high or low end of the projections (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

The current NDC target represents major progress beyond the Obama-era target of 26%–28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Nevertheless, the NDC is not ambitious enough to bring US domestic emissions in line with what would be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.

CAT analysis indicates that the US should aim to reduce its national emissions by at least 58% below 2005 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF) and provide support to other countries in order to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Doing so will also put the US on track to achieve the Biden Administration’s 2050 net zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b). The US has not submitted an update to its NDC since 2021, even though the Glasgow Climate Pact mandates countries revisit and strengthen their NDCs.

* The ‘Critically insufficient’ rating was based on the fact that the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and was not an assessment of the NDC emissions level, which itself would fall in the ‘Insufficient range’ based on the CAT’s prior rating system (which was updated in September 2021).

- 23.04.2021 “Ambitious US target upgrade reduces the 2030 global emissions gap by 5–10%”
- 12.12.2019 “The U.S. expected to rejoin the Paris Agreement in early 2021, bringing back the US leadership in climate action”
- 04.11.2019 “The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement”

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what would qualify as a country’s fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The US does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excluding emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry or LULUFC) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.**

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Although the target represents a significant improvement compared to its first NDC, the current target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvements.

NDC target against fair share

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that US’ NDC target for 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The US target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. The target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow US’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The US’ international climate finance contributions is rated “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve the US’ fair share rating.

We rate the US’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically insufficient.” The US has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been much lower than its fair share. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuel financing abroad (and not only coal).

The US Congress approved a budget allocation for international climate finance of no less than USD 0.9bn (Congressional Research Service, 2024) for FY2024, although the Biden Administration requested an allocation of USD 5bn. As a result of a more stringent federal spending cap, the FY2024 finance provision is less than the provision in the first years of the Biden Administration (Thwaites, 2024). For FY2025, the administration accordingly reduced its requested funding to USD 3.5bn.

The US State Department, however, claims it is on track to reach its pledge to contribute USD 11.4bn per year by 2024, with a projected contribution of USD 9.5bn in FY2023 (U.S. Department of State, 2024). The difference between the climate finance commitment approved by Congress and the total claimed by the State Department is due to the fact that Congress’ funding only represents a small share of US’ total international climate finance, as other agencies contribute the bulk of financing (Thwaites, 2024; U.S. Department of State, 2024). However, the sources of the US’ climate finance are not transparently reported.

While Congress’ budget allocation does not include any funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the US government has pledged to contribute USD 3bn to the GCF. The GCF is the primary international vehicle for supporting developing countries in their efforts to respond to and build resilience to the climate crisis (DeLauro, 2022).

The commitment of USD 11.4bn per year by 2024 falls short of the US’ fair contribution. While the OECD reported in 2022 that international climate finance provided by developed countries exceeded the USD 100bn goal per year for the first time, a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” for post-2025 is already being discussed by UNFCCC parties (UNFCCC, 2024).

To demonstrate global leadership on climate finance and to contribute towards its fair share, the US needs to substantially scale up its international climate finance provisions. The CAT finance rating would improve if the US were to successfully augment its level of finance through a sustained upwards trend in annual contributions.

The US has historically provided a significant portion of its climate-related financial contributions as grants, which are more concessional than loans. Climate finance contributions declined during the Trump Administration, but this trend has since been reversed by the Biden Administration, which in 2021 increased its bilateral climate-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) (OECD, 2022).

Bilateral climate finance by the US, as reported as principal and significant financing, further increased in 2022 as a result of an increase in adaptation financing. Principal mitigation financing actually decreased by half, from almost USD 1bn to less than USD 500m, reflecting a shift by the Biden Administration towards adaptation financing (OECD, 2024). Overall, the US' allocation of funding to bilateral climate-related ODA increased from 3% in 2021 to 10% in 2022 of total ODA spending, but remains well below the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries' average of 24% (Donor Tracker, 2021, 2023). This continues to highlight a substantial shortage in the US' financial commitment to addressing climate change through ODA. Increasing these contributions would not only allow the US to play a larger role in global climate action, but would also align with its renewed commitment to international cooperation under the Biden Administration.

The US, along with several other countries, agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” by the end of 2022 (The White House, 2021a). The 2023 G7 Communique claims to have achieved this goal (The White House, 2023d). However, the US has neither developed plans nor introduced policies to implement this commitment. The US also has not supported a proposal put forward by the European Union to end fossil fuel finance from export banks (E&E News by POLITICO, 2024).

In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the US (EXIM), an independent US government agency that provides concessions for projects that seek to boost US exports, continued to lend money to foreign fossil fuel projects, including USD 100m to Indonesia’s national oil company to expand an oil refinery and boost production. Estimates suggest that EXIM’s total lending amounted to USD 1bn in 2023 (Aronoff, 2023).

While the US government claims to be actively working with EXIM to end its financing of fossil fuel projects, the export agency itself does not seem to take a proactive role in doing so, claiming it has no jurisdiction to end these projects (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). In January 2024, EXIM’s lack of action resulted in two members of the agency’s climate advisory board resigning over a decision to support a fossil fuel project in Bahrain (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024). EXIM plans to finance further fossil fuel projects, including in Guyana, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea (Friends of the Earth US, 2024).

Although the US has not approved any new domestic coal projects in more than a decade (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024), the US continues to support existing coal projects abroad, such as the Jawa 9-10 Suralaya Coal Plant in Indonesia and the Long Phu 1 Coal Plant in Vietnam (EndCoal, 2020). The US should stop supporting all fossil fuel developments abroad to improve its climate finance rating.


## Net zero target

The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, in which the US officially commits to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning (U.S. Department of State, 2021).

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping in its target coverage. It could also explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without the use of international offsets.

The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The US government should further explain how its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

**For the full analysis of the net zero target, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

The effects of COVID-19 induced a temporary drop in emissions that helped the US meet its 2020 targets under the Copenhagen Accord. Total emissions in 2020 decreased by 22% below 2005 as a result of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. The US 2020 target was to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 (U.S. Department of State, 2010). Despite reaching the 2020 target, GHG emissions bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.


# Summary


## Overview

**Under the Biden Administration, the US has seen promising signs of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is mobilising historic levels of investment in clean energy solutions and activating subnational and non-state action on climate change. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recently revised regulations in the power and transport sectors further enhance the government’s climate policy package.**

**Although the country has made progress under the Biden Administration, the US will still be far from meeting its domestic climate target—let alone aligning its emissions with a 1.5°C trajectory—without additional, drastic emissions reductions measures. To meet its domestic target, the US would need to bolster its policy packages at the sectoral level to address the rising demand for electricity across sectors.**

**The government would also need to reverse the trend of increasing fossil fuel extraction.** **CAT analysis**** in 2022 shows the US is also moving in the wrong direction regarding its international support for fossil fuels. Overall, the CAT rates the US climate targets, action, and climate finance at the end of the Biden Administration as “Insufficient”. An assessment of the impact of the Trump Administration will follow once information is available.**

On 5 November 2024, former President Donald Trump won the US election, and will take office on 20 January 2025. The US will continue to face the challenges in meeting its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and achieving future climate goals aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. Reaching these targets will require the implementation of additional policies, which may prove challenging under the Trump Administration. However, opportunities remain for climate action at the state and municipality level and for furthering the progress made under the IRA.

As of 2022, the US has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target. CAT current policies projections, which include the IRA, show a more pronounced reduction in emissions until 2030 compared to historic reductions. Although CAT projections suggest the US will close the gap by an additional 30%–44% by 2030, it is still 23%–37% short of meeting its 2030 emissions reduction target; evidence that further action is critically necessary. The current US target of 50–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 is not 1.5˚C compatible.

**Although there have been positive developments under the IRA, oil and gas production** **has increased under the Biden Administration.** The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record-level production in 2023. The country is also the worlds' largest fossil gas producer and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter for liquified natural gas (LNG). In 2022, fossil fuels also received the largest subsidies from the government since 2010. In early 2024, the Biden Administration placed a temporary moratorium on pending LNG export terminals. However, the administration continues to approve large-scale fossil fuel projects.

**The IRA has had its most positive impact on the power sector**. The government’s decarbonisation target for the power sector aligns with the CAT’s Paris Agreement-compatible benchmarks, as well as with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero strategy: by 2035, the US aims to achieve net zero emissions in the sector. The IRA has stimulated large investment in technologies critical for decarbonising the power sector, but barriers remain; especially since the demand for electricity is expected to grow significantly. Important areas for the power sector's transition, such as the electricity grid, have been significantly underfunded. The anticipated coal phase-out, as out outlined in the recently revised EPA standards, will be too late to be Paris Agreement compatible, and fossil gas-fired plants are largely exempt from the standards.

**In the transport sector, the IRA has particularly supported the manufacturing and uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), while the EPA has enhanced the regulatory framework for EVs by revising its emissions standards until 2032.** The government aims to decarbonise the sector by 2050. However, this timeline is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The IRA has spurred significant investment in the domestic EV value chain, especially in battery manufacturing, and the deployment of HDVs in commercial and public fleets. The act also expands subsidies for EV purchases and unlocks new funding for public transport.

**A major ambition gap continues to exist in the industry sector, where the government has set a decarbonisation objective but has not specified a clear timeline for reaching the objective.** The IRA provides a patchwork of instruments to support technologies to decarbonise the industry sector. The IRA unlocks billions in funding for industrial technologies in their research and development phase, while introducing and expanding tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage deployment, renewable energy and critical material projects, and clean hydrogen production. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM) continues to phase down F-gases significantly.

**The government’s emissions reductions targets for the buildings sector are not aligned with the Paris Agreement.** Due to limited federal measures to regulate building energy use and emissions, the decarbonisation of the sector will likely heavily rely on electrification. Without further efforts to reduce building envelope energy use and emissions, this dependency will put increasing pressure on the power sector and its decarbonisation.

**The agriculture sector lacks a clear decarbonisation objective and, while the IRA allocates funding to boost conservation programmes, the act’s measures do not seem to meaningfully reduce sectoral emissions and even include funding for livestock production.** The US has neither developed or implemented any regulations to address emissions from animal production, nor has it meaningfully encouraged dietary change. Such demand-side changes could result in large mitigation impacts in the US, which has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world.

**Net forest sinks are threatened by land conversion, increasing demand for timber products, and more frequent natural disturbances from climate change.** The IRA increased funding for the National Forest Service and other programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities, but logging efforts are nevertheless set to increase.

**Aside from strengthening its sectoral policies and targets and reducing fossil fuel exploitation and exportation, the US should address gaps in its international climate contributions:**

- **Increase international climate finance contributions and cease funding fossil fuels abroad.** The Biden Administration is still far from reaching its pledge of USD 11.4bn/year. In FY2023, only USD 1bn was appropriated for climate finance by the US Congress. The US also broke its commitment to stop financing fossil fuels abroad when the American Export-Import Bank (EXIM) lent USD 100m to Indonesia to expand an oil refinery in May 2023.
- **Increase the ambition of its NDC.** The US has not yet updated its climate target despite the commitment to do so by countries at COP26 in 2021. For the US climate target to be compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory, the country must reduce its emissions by at least 62%–65% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF), while providing more financial support to other countries.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the combination of the US 2030 climate targets, policies, and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the totality of the government’s policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The US 2030 domestic emissions reduction target (NDC) is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways, but not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. US policies and action lead to falling emissions in 2030, but not by enough to meet either its targets or the 1.5°C limit.

The US does not meet its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its domestic targets and policies, needs to provide and mobilise further support to developing countries.

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its mitigation targets. The CAT projects US GHG emissions in 2030 to be 29%–39% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), falling short of its 2030 NDC target (44%–49% excl. LULUCF), and significantly short of its fair share target.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. Although the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry, it is the most ambitious climate policy package in US history and brings the country closer to meeting its 2030 target.

Although the IRA is a major step towards achieving the US NDC, the government still needs to introduce additional policies and action to achieve its domestic emissions reduction target. EPA standards in the power and transport sector passed in 2024 are important complementary instruments. However, more ambitious (sectoral) climate policies at the federal and state levels are still needed to reach the US targets. The increasing trend in oil and gas production also needs to be reversed.

The projected emissions trajectory range in this update is wider than in the previous update, due to the inclusion of a broader set of models to estimate the IRA's impact. The range of policy projections for the US falls into the “Insufficient” category but reaches the “Almost sufficient” category at its lower end.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the government’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvement to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**See full summary of** **policies and actions here****.**

We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US domestic target for 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the US target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The CAT’s assessment of the US’ total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the 2030 target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of further financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

We rate the United States’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on the government’s 2022 OECD contributions. The Biden Administration committed to increase its climate finance contributions but contributions until 2024 remain low compared to its fair share. In FY2024, only USD 1bn (approximately the same amount as in 2023) were appropriated for climate finance by Congress.

While the government claims larger sums have been made available (notably, USD 5.8 bn in 2022), these funds mainly relate to adaptation and/or are not principal financing. Only principal mitigation financing is accounted for in the CAT's rating. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and stop supporting fossil fuels abroad.

The US’ climate finance is not sufficient to improve the rating of its NDC against its fair share, and the CAT rates the US’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

We evaluate the US net zero target as: **Average.** The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), in which the US officially commits to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 latest.

The net zero target covers all GHG emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature- and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target, such as including international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly committing to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

The Biden Administration submitted the US long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), officially committing the US to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by land-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping to its target coverage, and explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets. The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The government further ought to explain how and why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

The foreseen use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the government’s plan is concerning given that CCS is not commercially viable due to its high additional costs and does not reduce the emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). Modelling exercises examining a net zero power sector by 2035 highlight that under a variety of scenarios considering different technology options, fossil CCS plays a diminishing or no role at all (Denholm et al., 2022). While the strategy acknowledges the uncertainties around carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, further emissions reductions efforts should be undertaken to reduce the significant amount of CDR required in the strategy: CDR should only be treated as a last-resort option.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The US government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Emissions coverage** – The US net zero target includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The US government deliberately excludes international aviation and shipping from its net zero target’s coverage (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The US government reserves its right to use international market mechanisms towards the achievement of this net zero goal (U.S. Department of State, 2021), even if it currently does not expect to do so.
- **Legal status** – The US government submitted its updated long-term strategy (LTS) including its net zero announcement to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The net zero target has not yet been enshrined in law as of November 2024.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The US government does not provide separate emissions reductions and removal targets. However, the US provides projections on its use of direct air capture (DAC) and LULUCF in its LTS.
- **Review process** – The LTS specifies that progress toward the net zero target will be regularly assessed without providing further specific information on the envisioned process. The government has indicated that it may update the LTS in the future, but has not committed to any legally-binding revision process.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The US government provides transparent assumptions and pathways on both natural sinks and technology-based CDR towards 2050 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Land‑based sinks reach roughly 600–1,400 MtCO2e in 2050, while technology-based CDR reaches roughly 300–500 MtCO2e in 2050. On the latter, no detailed information is provided on storage capacities for captured carbon emissions, nor the combination of technologies envisioned to increase this sink. As the CAT’s net zero evaluations across all countries highlight, this represents a higher reliance on CDR compared to the average of the other G20 countries that are member of the Climate Neutrality Coalition: on average G20 countries have 5% residual emissions in the target year whereas the US include 8%-23% residual emissions in 2050 as a share of 2019 emissions.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The updated LTS presents multiple pathways and a set of transparent assumptions to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The government has outlined multiple measures and actions across different sectors, most prominently to fully decarbonise domestic electricity supply by 2035 (assuming a substantial increase of electricity generation capacity using fossil fuels equipped with CCS in 2050).Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed”(IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.
- The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The US government makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The Trump Administration’s move to exit the Paris Agreement will effectively annul the 2035 climate target submitted by the Biden Administration in late 2024. More importantly and more materially, the Trump Administration’s actions to dismantle policies and rescind funding for climate change mitigation means that limiting peak global warming to 1.5°C will be even more challenging and will require other countries to make more rapid and even deeper emissions reductions. The Trump Administration’s climate agenda is seriously risking a high, multi-decadal overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s long-term 1.5°C temperature limit, even if a future US administration strengthens its targets and actions.

The 2035 NDC submitted by the Biden Administration can still act as a guide for subnational and non-state entities to continue climate action in the US, even as the Trump Administration has initiated the process to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, it should be noted that the Biden era 2035 climate target is not 1.5˚C aligned. Therefore, subnational actors seeking to advance Paris-aligned action must go beyond this target and its measures.

The Biden Administration's NDC sets a 2035 target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 61–66% below 2005 levels. The target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT, which excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), finds that the target results in 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035. This target is not 1.5°C-compatible against modelled domestic pathways: a 1.5°C compatible emissions level, excluding LULUCF, would be 2,200 MtCO2e in 2035.

At the time the Biden Administration submitted the NDC, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were the central federal mechanisms for driving emission reductions towards the 2035 target. However, under the CAT's current policy projections—which consider the impact of the BIL and IRA and were developed before the Trump Administration took office—the US will not reduce emissions fast enough to reach the 2035 target.

To reach the Biden Administration’s target, the US government would have needed to implement new, additional climate policies and actions; an outlook that the Trump Administration has rendered unlikely, as it has already taken executive actions to repeal existing climate policies, including the BIL and IRA, limit federal funding for climate action, and expand fossil fuel production.

The Biden Administration worked in close collaboration and cooperation with subnational actors in state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments to develop the 2035 target. If the Trump Administration continues to obstruct and undo climate policies, subnational and non-state actors need to slow the impact of the federal rollback of climate policies by strengthening climate action at the subnational level.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The US’ submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The submitted NDC of 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, the US would need to reduce its emissions, excluding LULUCF, to 2,225 MtCO2e in 2035. The 2035 NDC does not increase the 2030 NDC target’s ambition.

The US 2035 economy-wide target does not include specific sectoral plans and targets. The NDC does outline the key federal policies in the power, buildings, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors that were expected to drive emissions reductions towards the 2035 target. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—both of which were developed by the Biden Administration and were introduced after the US 2030 NDC submission—are described as the principal national-level policies for achieving the 2035 target. The BIL aims to expedite the development and implementation of clean energy infrastructure. The IRA is intended to mobilise unprecedented public and private investment in clean energy production. In combination, the BIL and IRA were planned to incentivise and accelerate climate action across the US economy and, since their introduction, have already reduced emissions.

It is important to note that the future of both the BIL and IRA is uncertain. The Trump Administration has already taken executive action to freeze federal funding under both laws, and has signalled that it will try to roll back certain components. While the Trump Administration cannot use executive action to unilaterally repeal either the BIL or IRA, Republican majorities in the House and in Congress may be supportive of and carry out the administration’s agenda. As of October 2024, Republicans voted 53 times in the House and once in the Senate to repeal certain climate provisions in the IRA since its introduction in 2022.

The NDC explicitly draws attention to the US federal governance structure and highlights the importance and capacity of state and other subnational governments to contribute towards the 2035 target. State governments are especially well-positioned to reduce emissions in the power, transport, and buildings sectors. However, if the Trump Administration, with support from the Republican majority in both the House and Congress, permanently restricts funding or reverses regulations for the BIL and IRA’s implementation, it is unclear whether subnational entities would be able to make up the lack of federal funding and policies.

The 2035 NDC does not include a renewable energy capacity target. Instead, the document references the US power sector target of generating 100% “clean,” “carbon pollution-free" electricity by 2035. This target is not—and should not be—conflated with a renewable energy target. The target’s formulation allows the government to use fossil energy with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), as well as nuclear and biomass energy, to achieve the target. The NDC cites the current share of renewable energy generation, which has more than doubled over the past decade; in 2023, renewables generated 21% of the US electricity.

The NDC claims the 2035 target is fully aligned with its net zero pathway; it argues that “the entire 2035 range is on a straight line or steeper trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 for all greenhouse gases.” To achieve its net zero target, the CAT estimates the US needs to reduce emissions to 558–1,540 MtCO2e or 80-93% below 2005 levels in 2050, excluding LULUCF. Assuming the US realises its 2030 NDC target, the 2035 NDC target is aligned with the median net zero pathway, but not the pathway’s uppermost bound. Further information on the US net zero target can be found here.

The NDC explicitly refers to the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake. The NDC outlines targets, measures, and metrics that correspond with some of the Global Stocktake’s sectoral goals. Highlights include references to the US expansion of renewable energy generation, the rate of electrification and energy efficiency improvements, the adoption of zero- and low-emissions vehicles, and the commitment to halting and reversing deforestation by 2030. It is important to note that the US does not commit to phasing out either fossil gas or coal.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries.

In its 2035 NDC, the US does not acknowledge its responsibility, nor communicate its intention to provide and mobilise climate finance to other countries. The US did not do so in its 2030 NDC either. Developed countries, like the US, are expected to complement their domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The US submitted 2035 NDC is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reductions target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the still significant emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The US 2035 NDC details the planning processes behind the target’s development and the existing measures for its implementation. However, the CAT finds that the US would need to go beyond the Biden Administration’s policies and actions and enact new measures to reach the 2035 target. The Trump Administration has vowed to reverse the Biden Administration's course on climate action and has already taken executive action to undermine many of the policies that underpin the NDC. The administration’s initiation of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement essentially voids the NDC, and the administration's actions entirely compromise the target’s credibility.

The US needs to implement new, additional climate policies and actions to reach its 2035 target, as current policies are insufficient. The CAT estimates that existing policies will reduce emissions by 33–50% below 2005 levels in 2035, emitting 3,780–5,071 MtCO2e in 2035, well below a 1.5˚C compatible level of 2,225 MtCO2e.

The 2035 NDC’s development was coordinated and managed by the Biden Administration’s White House Climate Policy Office. Central to the target’s development was a bottom-up analysis of existing and possible policies at the national, subnational, and non-state level.

The revision was drafted in consultation and cooperation with a broad, diverse coalition of state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments, as well as workers unions, private sector representatives, civil society organisations, and higher education institutions. In doing so, the NDC acknowledges the important role of subnational and non-state climate action.

While the NDC highlights the importance of subnational and non-state climate action, it also identifies national-level policies that are key to the realisation of the 2035 target. The BIL and IRA are described as “the backbone of the suite of existing federal legislation and investments that are contributing to the achievement the 2035 NDC target.” However, the future of these policies is uncertain. The Trump Administration has signalled that it will try to eliminate components of the BIL and IRA and has also initiated processes to reverse emissions standards in the power and transport sectors; the standards that were strengthened under the Biden Administration and are cited in the NDC as important components for realising the 2035 target.

In its NDC, the US does not commit to discontinuing fossil fuel exploration, production, or subsidies. The US is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and fossil gas. Since 2022, the US is the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG). The US government continues to heavily subsidise fossil fuels: in 2023, fossil fuel subsidies totalled nearly USD 15bn. The US plans to expand oil and gas production and increase LNG exports. The US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) most recent projections of the US energy market forecast that fossil gas production will increase by 15% and LNG exports will increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest emitters in the world, the US has a responsibility to take ambitious action to phase out fossil fuels.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emissions reductions target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) to ensure they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The US 2035 NDC target is not based on an absolute value. Instead, the target is formulated as a percentage reduction below 2005 levels.

The NDC target covers all sectors, including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The NDC does not break down the economy-wide target by sector. As a result, it is unclear how each sector would contribute to meeting the target. The inclusion of the LULUCF sector’s emissions, which are uniquely challenging to account for, undermines the target’s transparency.

The target considers all greenhouse gas emissions, but does not set targets for specific greenhouse gases. However, the NDC anticipates a reduction of methane emissions of at least 35% below 2005 levels in 2035. The NDC also forecasts “significant emissions reductions from other non-carbon dioxide super pollutants.”

The 2035 NDC does not define a specific emissions pathway, claiming “the NDC is built on the premise that there are multiple pathways to achieving the expected level of emissions reductions.” The NDC does not provide any further clarification on the number of and differences between pathways.

In the NDC, the US does not transparently communicate the intended or expected contribution of the carbon dioxide removals (CDR) or carbon markets. The NDC leaves the door open for the use of contentious voluntary carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; the NDC notes, in the case that the US relies on carbon markets to achieve its target, the government would appropriately report the use of such market mechanisms.

# Policies & action

According to our analysis, the US will need to implement additional policies to reach its targets. We project GHG emissions will reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e in 2030 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF). This is equivalent to 29%–39% reduction from 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), which is insufficient to meet the NDC target (45%–50% excl. LULUCF).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, represents a significant milestone in US climate policy. While its full impact is still unfolding due to the nature of its 10-year implementation plan, the first years have shown real promise. The IRA is mobilising historic investments in clean energy, driving clean projects, creating jobs, and attracting private sector funding. EPA standards for the power and transport sectors, passed in 2024, provide two further milestones in important policy areas.

However, to achieve its domestic emissions reductions target—let alone to reach a 1.5°C-compatible emissions level—the government needs to complement its recent advancements with further sector-specific policies and a shift away from fossil fuels.

The projected emissions trajectory range is wider in this update than previously, due to the incorporation of new analyses that better highlight the uncertainties related to the IRA's implementation. While the middle of the policy projections' range falls into the “Insufficient” category, its lower end, representing a positive outlook on the government’s current policies, falls into the “Almost sufficient” range.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the US’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The Biden Administration has set the goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, which is consistent with a Paris Agreement pathway.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its 2030 and long-term targets. After an increase in GHG emissions between 2021 and 2022, emissions started to decline in 2023 (-1.9%) (Rhodium Group, 2024). The government has set a target to reduce emissions by 3.8–4.2 GtCO2e/year in 2030.

According to our projections, emissions are forecasted to decline at an average of 1.7%–3.9% per year and reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e/year by 2030 (29%–39% below 2005 levels; and 19%–31% below 1990), excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Under these projections, the US would achieve 64%–87% of its emissions reductions target in 2030, indicating a gap of 13%–36% that would need to be filled with new and additional climate policies and action. As it stands, the 2030 target is not 1.5˚C compatible. Reaching a level in line with a global least-cost pathway requires further reductions of 1.4–2.2 GtCO2e below the current policy pathway.

Compared to CAT projections in August 2023, our range of emission projections includes an updated estimate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) impact, as well as estimates of the impact of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2024 regulations for the power and transport sectors. As a result, the US emissions projections decreased relative to the CAT’s previous projections, while the range, based on existing policies, widened for 2030–2035. The upper bound decreased by 2% and the lower bound decreased by 8%. The reduced, widened range in emission projections highlights the continued effort by the US government to cut emissions, while recognising the high uncertainty of policy outcomes; especially for the government’s flagship climate policies, including the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

The IRA injects USD 370bn into the US economy over a 10-year period. This infusion takes the form of tax credits, grants, and loans intended to develop and deploy the clean energy technologies and investments that are essential for the economy's decarbonisation (The White House, 2023a).

Since the IRA's implementation in 2022, the country has witnessed a significant surge in public and private investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure: between August 2022 and February 2024, investment in announced clean energy projects and infrastructure totalled USD 352bn. Specific highlights include record investment in battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and in grid and transmission infrastructure (Climate Power, 2024c).

Due to these investments, the share of clean energy investments in total investments increased from 3.7% in Q4 of 2022 to 5% in Q4 in 2023, representing a significant uptick in the role that clean energy investments play in the US economy (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). Given the scale of public investment, some studies suggest that the IRA could spur USD 3tn in private investments over the coming decade (Goldman Sachs, 2023).

The BIL and IRA, alongside the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, have set the stage for record private investment in the construction of domestic manufacturing facilities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023b). Before the IRA and CHIPS Act were signed, annual investment in manufacturing construction remained below USD 150bn. Since the acts’ passage, investment surged to an all-time high of USD 223bn by February 2024 (FRED Economic data, 2024; Joint Economic Committee, 2024).

Investment in the EV supply chain, especially in battery cell manufacturing and critical mineral production, has increased significantly and accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clean manufacturing investments by the end of 2023 (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). As a result of this increase in investment, the US surpassed the EU in battery cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, even though the EU’s capacity was two times larger than the US’ capacity in 2021 (Delgado et al., 2024).

These investments contribute to job creation, with estimates showing that the IRA’s provisions have already generated over 270,000 clean energy jobs (Climate Power, 2024b). The act has also contributed to a more just energy transition by targeting disadvantaged communities and rural areas. Many of the announced investments specifically target and aim to contribute to the economic development of these regions and communities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023a).

In early 2024, the US expanded its climate policy portfolio through the addition of several EPA policies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i, 2024l). The EPA introduced several standards for gas and coal-fired power plants and updated its vehicle emissions standards. Even though these standards were watered down before their finalisation (see Electricity generation and Transport sections below), they add an important regulatory complement to the incentive-based IRA: by setting yearly emissions levels for technologies, the standards provide important guidance for the private sector.

To realise its 2030 and 2035 targets and to align with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5˚C temperature goal, the US has to implement further, more ambitious policies and measures. Additional measures could focus on those sectors in which ambitious action has yet to be taken, such as the building or agriculture sector.

At the same time, the government can further strengthen existing policies across all sectors; for example, the government could extend the IRA beyond 2030, introduce coal phase-out targets for 2030, and enhance energy efficiency standards (America Is All In, 2024). Manufacturing capacity could also be strengthened, in particular for wind turbine and heat pump production (IEA, 2024a). Given that the federal government’s jurisdiction is limited some policy areas, state governments can play a significant role.

Some states, such as Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota, have recently introduced climate policies that are more ambitious than at the federal level (Joselow & Montalbano, 2023). To advance climate action at the subnational level, state governments can adopt of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and introduce sales targets for EVs.

Despite the IRA’s remarkable measures to support clean energy and address climate change, the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The concessions are described in the Power section.


## Power

Electricity supply contributed to 25% of total US GHG emissions in 2022 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). Total annual emissions in the power sector have declined steadily since 2010, mainly driven by a shift from coal to lower or non-emitting sources of generation, such as fossil gas and renewables.

Electricity production from renewables overtook production from coal and nuclear power for the first time in 2022, making renewables the country’s second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j). Coal has now becoming the least relevant generation source in the US (excluding oil), if all forms of renewables are counted together. Following a drop in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions in the power sector returned to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovered but began dropping again in 2023. In 2021, electricity generation and emissions from coal-fired power plants increased for the first time since 2014 by 16% and 15%, respectively (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f).

The marked increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, and its sustained elevated level in 2022, can be mainly attributed to the significantly higher and more volatile prices of fossil gas as a consequence of the 2021 energy crisis, which rendered coal more competitive (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021b, 2023n).

In 2023, gas generation rebounded and replaced coal generation, which led to emissions reductions in the sector. Although renewables contributed to sectoral emissions reductions, fossil gas had more than double the growth rate of renewable generation.

The Biden Administration announced a target for a carbon-free electricity system by 2035. The CAT estimates that the full decarbonisation of the US power sector by 2035 would reduce total economy-wide emissions by about 25% below 2005 levels by 2030. The goal of a carbon-free power supply by 2035 is aligned with the Paris Agreement (PA), based on the CAT’s primary global least-cost based benchmarks (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b), as well as with the IEA’s suggested net zero target year for advanced economies (IEA, 2021). If accompanied by ambitious electrification targets in other sectors, such as 100% EV sales by 2030 or the full electrification of building heating, the US would be on track to meet the target of 50%–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b).

It is important to note that since setting the 2035 target, the US government reframed its position on phasing out fossil fuels: the US now aims to achieve “a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035" instead of a “carbon pollution free” sector. Such reformulation enables the use of abated fossil fuel generation (e.g. with carbon capture and storage), as well as the use of fossil fuels in sectors that are not directly related to electricity generation (GEM Wiki, 2024).

However, emissions in the power sector must reduce more rapidly to reach the US economy-wide target. In 2021, total emissions from electricity generation had decreased by 36% compared to 2005 levels. With the introduction of the IRA, emissions from electricity generation are projected to further decrease by 67%–87% compared to 2005 levels by 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b). More recent analysis, which takes into account the recent EPA regulations in the power sector, suggests that emissions might be even further reduced to 90% below 2005 levels by 2035 (King, Kolus, et al., 2024).

Nevertheless, a gap remains between the projections and target, highlighting the need for additional, more ambitious policies and actions.

The US is making **“Slow Progress”** on deploying renewables. The share of renewables in US electricity generation gradually increased over the last five years and accounted for approximately 24% of total US electricity generation in 2024. Increasingly cost-competitive renewables, in combination with the IRA and state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS), are driving this growth. Although moving in the right direction, the deployment of renewables needs significant acceleration over the next three decades to be compatible with 1.5°C. To align with 1.5°C, the share of renewables needs to increase to 68% by 2030, to 92% by 2040, and to 95% by 2050.

In 2024, renewables generated approximately 24% of total US electricity. Wind, hydropower, and solar represented the greatest shares. Over the past five years, installed solar and wind capacities increased by an average of 28 GW per year (CAT Power Eval). Nearly 75% of added generation capacity in 2022 were renewables. The installed capacity of solar increased by roughly 20 GW in 2023 and is projected to increase by 36 GW in 2024. The annual expansion of wind capacity lags behind solar; wind capacity grew by only 6 GW in 2023 and is forecasted to increase by 7 GW in 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e).

Modelling of the IRA’s impact on renewables suggests an average capacity deployment of 54 GW/year for renewables, driven mainly by the expansion of wind and solar (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

However, according to scenarios that model a 100% clean energy power sector by 2035, annual additions in renewable energy capacity need to increase significantly more. To achieve 100% renewable energy generation by 2035, the installed capacity of wind would need to grow by 70–145 GW/year between 2025 and 2035. During the same period, the installed capacity of solar would need to increase by 43–90 GW/year (Denholm et al., 2022).

The clean energy project pipeline emerging as a result of the IRA shows promising growth, having reached 309 GW of announced clean energy capacity (Cleanpower, 2024). The growth in clean energy projects is also reflected in the total project capacity seeking transmission access: in total, 1,480 GW of clean electricity generation are seeking transmission access, of which solar alone accounts for 1,086 GW. (WRI, 2024).

Historically only about 14% of announced capacity gets interconnected, but the number of new projects that were announced after the passage of the IRA (e.g. more than 500 GW of solar) reflect increased developer interest and may result in a higher interconnection rate. However, major challenges for the deployment of renewables persist: complex permitting processes, higher interest rates and costs, and supply chain issues will need to be overcome to ensure project implementation (WRI, 2024).

The IRA is strengthening value chains in the medium to long term in the US by incentivising domestic manufacturing (see above), but current supply chain issues remain. While issues with the solar supply chain have been improved, other decarbonisation-critical equipment, such as transformers, are subject to enduring supply chain issues, resulting in long lead times (WRI, 2024).

Hight interest rates have increased project costs, especially for renewables with high upfront costs, and have elevated prices for power purchase agreement (PPA). In turn, higher PPA prices have reduced clean energy purchases by corporates (WRI, 2024). To address risks that lead to and are associated with higher interest rates, the IRA allocates USD 3.6bn for clean energy loans to enable USD 40bn in loan guarantees, particularly targeting new technologies (Harper et al., 2023). Other instruments, such as contracts for difference, which the EU recommends in its market design directive to its Member States (European Commission, 2023), could help minimise risks and thus financing costs, especially for offshore wind (Beiter et al., 2024).

Expanding transmission lines is a major enabler for the deployment of renewables, especially wind and solar, and is essential for their overtaking of fossil gas as the primary source of electricity generation.

The historical pace of grid extension of about 1% per year needs to increase to 2.3% per year to reach the full reduction potential of the IRA; a net zero pathway would require an even faster expansion (Jenkins et al., 2022). Currently, only 10% of the necessary investment in transmission lines are in the pipeline (WRI, 2024).

This low level of investment is especially alarming given that transmission projects in the US take an average of 10 years to build (WRI, 2023). Although state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining and upgrading grid infrastructure, federal agencies are implementing several measures to augment investment. For instance, the US Department of Energy (DOE) introduced the Coordinated Interagency Authorizations and Permits programme (CITAP), which streamlines the permitting process for transmission facilities. The DOE also unlocked additional targeted funding to expand transmission capacity (S&P Global, 2024) and is in the process of developing auxiliary measures (WRI, 2024).

Another challenge for the power sector is the growing demand for electricity. The growth in demand is not only driven by the electrification needed for a decarbonised future, but also by the emergence of large-scale data centres, the increase in manufacturing facilities, the enhanced demand for building cooling and heating, and the introduction of hydrogen fuel plants. For instance, electricity demand from data centres, which currently account for around 4% of electricity demand, is expected to grow to between 4.6% - 9.1% of electricity demand by 2030 (EPRI, 2024).

Permitting and siting are major barriers for the buildout of renewable energy capacity. Current project build times average four years. The IRA includes USD 1bn to support the May 2022 Permitting Action Plan, which seeks to accelerate the federal permitting and environmental review process for transmission lines and clean energy productions.

However, action at the state level is key because permitting and siting processes are largely controlled by subnational jurisdictions. California and Massachusetts have implemented promising approaches for streamlining the permitting process for clean energy projects that could be replicated by other states (WRI, 2023).

The federal government is also working to address issues related to project siting. The government set a target to double clean energy permits on public lands in order to reach 25 GW of renewable energy generation by 2025. This goal was reached at the end of 2023, with a total of 29 GW worth of allocated permits. A further 32 GW are currently under consideration by the government (Reuters, 2024).

The US Department of the Interior (DOI) announced a plan to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and unlocked USD 3bn in federal loans for offshore wind and transmission projects. By the end of FY2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management aims to approve a cumulative 14.8 GW in offshore wind energy capacity to support the 2030 target (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023a). However, estimates suggest that only 14.5 GW will come online by 2030, which means the government will fall significantly short of its 30 GWs goal. Approximately 11 GW of planned offshore capacity have been cancelled or are being renegotiated (Canary Media, 2023).

A diverse set of drivers have been responsible for the growth of renewable energy in the US. At the subnational level, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and clean energy standards (CES) have been major drivers. In total, 32 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), accounting for 58% of US electricity sales, have enacted RPS or CES legislation. Of these, 15 states and D.C. have signed 100% clean electricity goals into legislation, while seven states have enacted such a target through state-level executive orders (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023c).

While in the past, roughly half of the growth in renewable generation capacity could be associated with these legislated policies, this number was reduced in recent years, reaching only 30% by 2022. With current RPS or CES legislation alone the share of non-hydro RE will only increase to 28% by 2050, well below what is needed (see below).

Other off-taker than utilities covered by PPA such as such as voluntary utility procurements, net metered PV/onsite production or corporate PPAs have become drivers for the development of renewable energy sources. (Barbose, 2023) Given their uncertain outcome and the reduced success in recent years of high interest rates (see above), a means of ensuring the necessary capacity is built could be to extend the RPS to cover more state with increased ambition.

At the federal level, the tax credits for the production and investment in clean energy support the buildout of renewables**.** The Biden Administration modified and extended current Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit through 2024, at which point the credits transition towards technology-neutral, emissions-based credits in the form of the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Energy Investment Tax Credit.

Importantly, the current tax credit applies to all projects that commence construction by 2032, providing additional investor certainty (Harper et al., 2023). Both credits incentivise investment in disadvantaged communities and provide additional bonuses to wind and solar projects in low-income neighbourhoods (The White House, 2023c). The direct impact of these credits is uncertain and difficult to assess as they overlap, complement, and engage with other incentive schemes and market dynamics.

An EPA review of scenarios estimating the IRA’s impact, which this assessment uses for the current policy projections scenario, shows that the implementation of the IRA could lead to emission reductions of between 49%–83% in the power sector by 2030 below 2005 levels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d). The modelling projects that the share of renewables in total electricity generation will increase significantly, reaching 28%–60% in 2030 and amounting to up to 85% in 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

However, these penetration levels are insufficient to meet the Biden Administration’s 2035 goal of a carbon-free power sector. In order to be aligned with a Paris Agreement-compatible, least-cost pathway, the CAT estimates that 68%–86% of the electricity generated by 2030 should come from renewable sources (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

With an increasing share of variable renewable energy in the US electricity generation mix, there is an increasing need for supply and demand-side flexibilities. Storage needs will increase as gas-fired power plants, currently providing flexibility services, are phased out.

To decarbonise the power sector by 2035, approximately 120–350 GW of diurnal storage and up to 680 GW of seasonal storage is required in a scenario that does not include carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Harper et al., 2023). The need for utility storage and demand flexibility is also directly linked to the buildout of the transmission grid which, as highlighted above, is happening far too slowly. Building out storage capacity can reduce the need for transmission expansion and vice versa.

The IRA has spurred a significant increase in utility-scale diurnal storage projects, as evidenced by the number of storage project awaiting interconnection. Since August 2022, more than 540 GW of storage have requested interconnection, with approximately half of that storage capacity combined with a generation technology, mainly solar. In total, around 514 GW of storage is proposed to come online before the end of 2026.

Historically, only 11% of planned storage capacity has come online. However, the operationalisation rate might increase given that the IRA makes available Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits for standalone storage projects. In the current storage project pipeline, battery storage dominates. The number of other storage technologies in the pipeline, notably those better suited for seasonal storage, has also increased.

In contrast to supply flexibility, demand flexibility remains underdeveloped in the US and worldwide. Economic analyses of the US suggest that it can reduce the costs of grid extension and ancillary service costs by approximately USD 13bn/year, while simultaneously contributing to the integration of renewables (Bronski et al., 2015).

Demand flexibility can play an important role, as transmission projects are developing too slowly, and storage projects incur additional resource use. States are beginning to recognise the importance of demand flexibility: state level institutions, such as the California Utility Commission, are starting processes to enable “widespread demand flexibility” (California Public Utilities Commission, 2022). Nevertheless, demand flexibility continues to be largely underfunded.

Seasonal storage, or long-duration storage, is underdeveloped, but will likely be critical to decarbonising the power sector by 2035. Unlike for short-term, diurnal storage, where batteries have emerged as a promising, increasingly cost-competitive technology, seasonal storage is much less mature and requires significant investments in research and development. The DOE is beginning to support seasonal storage projects; it is providing a USD 504.4m loan guarantee for a hydrogen storage capacity in Utah and introduced the Long Duration Storage Shot that aims to decrease costs for seasonal storage by 90% within the coming decade (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023c). However, the government’s efforts must be intensified to deploy the technology at the scale and pace to achieve sectoral decarbonisation.

The US is headed in the **“Wrong Direction”** on fossil gas. The US has not committed to phasing out fossil gas and, over the past five years, has expanded fossil gas generation capacity. In 2024, fossil gas was the largest source of electricity, generating 43% of all electricity. The US needs to phase out fossil gas by 2035 in order to be 1.5°C compatible.

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets new gas-fired power plants. The EPA’s emissions standards for fossil gas distinguish between baseload and peak power plants: the standards only apply to baseload plants larger than 300MW. Plants covered by the regulation have the option to capture 90% of emitted CO2 using CCS by 2035 or transition to 96% hydrogen fuel use by 2038. These standards are projected to reduce fossil gas emissions by approximately 200–400 MtCO2e by the mid-2040s. The combined cumulative reductions for both coal and fossil gas are forecasted to amount to 600 MtCO2e by 2050. (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023h). While setting emissions limits for power plants is a step in the right direction, the regulation’s impact remains uncertain as smaller baseload plants and peak power plants are not covered.

The US is making **“Slow Progress”** on reducing the share of coal in its power mix. For the past five years, the share of coal in electricity generation has decreased by 1.4% per year. This decrease is largely driven by the continued buildout of fossil gas generation and the growth of renewable generation rather than by a federal policy push, as the US government has not set a phase-out target for coal. To be compatible with 1.5°C, the US needs to phase out coal generation by 2030.

In April 2024, the US, alongside all G7 member countries, took a positive step in the right direction by agreeing to phase out all unabated coal power generation by 2035. However, the pledge’s formulation provides flexibility for countries to reach the target. Countries do not necessarily have phase out coal by 2035 but can instead purse an alternative “timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5-degrees-Celsius temperature rise within reach, in line with countries' net zero pathways.” The pledge’s formulation also enables the use of abated coal generation using carbon capture and storage technology.

Elevated fossil gas prices induced a temporary increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, which did not last, as gas prices returned to 2020 levels in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024c). As a result, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants reduced from 48% to 42% (Inside Climate News, 2024), a trend that reflects the worsening economics of coal but also a trend that could be reversed in future if coal-fired power plants are not shut down.

Approximately 30% of the US coal-fired generating capacity has been retired since 2010: no new coal-fired capacity has been installed since 2013, and more coal power plants are due to be decommissioned in the near future (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021a, 2023g, 2023k). However, the retirement of coal generation capacity has slowed in recent years and is expected to continue to slow in 2024. Although the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected 8.9 GW of coal-fired power plants to retire in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g), only 5 GW actually retired (Ember, 2024). For 2024, only 2.3 GW of coal-fired power plants are set to retire, corresponding to 1.3% of total the coal fleet (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024d).

In comparison, annual coal retirements averaged 11 GW between 2015 and 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023g).The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, use as one of the reference scenarios for this assessment’s current policy projections, suggests that no new coal-fired capacity will be added in the US. In the reference case, coal-fired capacity is projected to decline by 64% to 73 GW by 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023h).

This means that a full phase-out of coal power by 2035 would require additional policy action to accelerate and reinforce market forces that, as evidenced by the last decade, are pushing coal out of the mix. According to the CAT, the US needs to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2030 to be aligned with the Paris Agreement (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets both existing coal-fired power plants and new gas-fired power plants. It includes standards for GHG emissions, waste water, mercury, and toxic metals. The standards set the most stringent emissions limits for both plant types in US history and mandate that all coal-fired power plants reduce or capture nearly all of their CO2 emissions by 2040 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The regulation exempts coal-fired plants that are set to retire before 2032, while relaxing the standards for those retiring between 2032 and 2039; these plants need to reduce emissions by only 16%. Coal plants that operate beyond 2039 will be required to reduce their emissions intensity by implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to capture 90% of CO2 emissions by 2032. These requirements are expected to accelerate coal plant retirements before the 2040 deadline, resulting in an additional 22 GW of coal-fired capacity going offline between 2023 and 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m).

The new regulations aim to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuel-fired power plants and explicitly allows for CCS, signalling that the government considers CCS a viable solution for emissions reductions in the mid to long term (Parenteau, 2024). However, CCS has yet to be proven commercially at scale, and it remains unclear whether the technology will have demonstrated commercial viability by 2040. Given the high cost of CCS application for fossil fuel-fired power plants (Clarke et al., 2022), our estimation is that the majority of fossil fuel-fired power plants that are subject to the proposed regulations will already cease operations by 2040.

However, if this is not the case and CCS gets deployed at scale, then the widespread adoption of CCS could lead to significant additional emissions given that current CCS technology only captures 90% of the plant’s emissions.

The EPA has encountered numerous challenges in regulating GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the past, including two failed attempts during the Obama and Trump Administrations. Most recently, in June 2022, the US Supreme Court ruled to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants (West Virginia v. EPA, 2022). The decision sets a worrying precedent for future climate action. However, experts suggest the design of the EPA’s most recent standards explicitly considers the weaknesses of previously proposed regulations and, therefore, gives the standards a better chance against legal challenges (Parenteau, 2024).

In parallel, the government passed stricter standards for power plants whose pollution crosses state lines (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e). The EPA has also proposed stronger limits for mercury and water pollution from coal-fired power plants. These rules do not target pollution that directly contributes to global warming, but, nevertheless, limit the operation of coal-fired power plants and, in doing so, could indirectly accelerate their phase-out (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023g, 2023j).

Unlike coal generation, oil and fossil gas generation increased significantly in 2023. More than 10GW of fossil gas-fired power plants were added in 2023, the highest increase since 2003 (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Generation from fossil gas grew more than twice as fast as generation from renewables in 2023 (Rhodium Group, 2024).

Studies suggest that lifetime use for fossil gas-fired plants breaks even after 9–17 years of operation under current regimes. The longevity of gas-fired power plants severely hampers the phase-out of fossil gas and, as a result, either jeopardises the sector’s 2035 decarbonisation target or invites the widespread deployment of CCS if the gas-fired fleet remains in operation or is expanded (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

The US is the world’s top oil and fossil gas producer

The US became the world’s largest producer of crude oil in 2018 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2018), reaching record levels of oil and gas production and exports in 2023. US crude oil exports hit a record 4.1 million barrels per day in 2023, corresponding to a 13% increase compared to previous record export level in 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024b). Increasing exports were driven by increased crude oil production, several releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and increased demand in Europe for an alternative to Russian crude oil (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023l).

Exports of petroleum products similarly increased: more petroleum products were exported—nearly six million barrels per day—in the first half of 2023 than in the first half of any prior year. Since 2020, growth in propane exports has driven growth in overall petroleum product exports; approximately 1.5 million barrels were exported per day in the first half of 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023e).

The US is also the largest producer of fossil gas. Liquified natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set records year after year. In the first half of 2022, the US became the world’s largest LNG exporter. By the first half of 2023, LNG exports had further increased by 4% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023d). This trend is expected to continue into the future as the US is planning to increase its LNG export capacity by more than 40% by 2026, compared to 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The growth in exports is mainly due to strong LNG demand from Europe, as well as expanded and reopened LNG capacity. In 2022, US LNG exports to Europe increased by 141% compared to 2021 levels (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023b). Outside of Europe, interest in - and demand for - US LNG is also growing. In Mexico, new LNG terminals, as well as an expanding pipeline network, are contributing to growth in LNG imports from the US. In Asia, exports from the US continue to increase; Japan, China, and India increased imports in 2023 relative to 2022, while the Philippines and Vietnam imported LNG from the US for the first time in 2023 (Zaretskaya, 2024).

In January 2024, the Biden Administration took a step towards addressing the climate impacts of US fossil fuel exports by issuing a temporary pause on the development of new LNG export terminals (Daly, 2024). The administration cited outdated project evaluation criteria, which inadequately capture the financial and environmental cost of new LNG infrastructure, as cause for the moratorium. As of October 2024, the pause remains in place. It is important to note that the pause does not impact operational, as well as approved, LNG terminals and, as a result, does not immediately impact the US supply of LNG to Europe and Asia (The White House, 2024b).

Although a step in the right direction, the US should take stronger, more consistent action to phase out fossil fuel production and exportation. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest GHG emitters and richest countries in the world, the US has a responsibility and is well-positioned to phase out fossil fuels.

On the international stage, the US has signalled support for a reduction in fossil fuel production: at COP26, the US pledged to end international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022 (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021b), and at COP27, the US supported language on a “fossil fuel phasedown”—but, as evidenced by ever increasing domestic oil and gas exploitation, the government has contradicted itself on this issue (CAT, 2023).

Record levels of fossil fuel production translate to record profits for oil and gas corporations. An analysis of five major fossil fuel corporations revealed that this set of companies earned USD 152bn in profit between 2017 and 2020 (Climate Power, 2024a). More recent data for 2021 through 2023 show that profits for the top ten largest oil and gas corporations by value tripled to USD 313bn under the Biden Administration in comparison to reported profits from 2017 through 2019 (McCormick & Smyth, 2024).

The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, included in the range of our current policy scenario projections, projects US fossil gas production to increase by 15% and LNG exports to increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a). This increase is due to the expected increase in domestic and foreign demand for fossil gas and a continued increase in LNG capacity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The US has one of the largest expansion plans for oil and gas projects in the world. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. With 22 oil and gas mega-project plans in place, the US accounts for more than one-fifth of potential emissions from major carbon emitting energy projects in the world. Together, these 22 mega-projects have the potential to emit nearly 143 GtCO2e in their lifetime, which is almost four times more than the entire world emits each year (Kühne et al., 2022).

(Climate Trace, 2023; Lu et al., 2023)Expansion of oil and gas projects is driven by planned increases in oil and gas fracking and LNG extraction (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023). In 2022, subsidies for fossil fuels, as defined as budgetary transfers, tax expenditures, and general supply- and demand-side financial support, reached their highest level since 2010: subsidies amounted to USD 14bn in 2022 (Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker, 2022).

Fossil fuel subsidies have and will continue to spur the expansion of fossil fuel projects: research indicates that two of the largest and longest standing subsidies—the ‘expensing of intangible drilling costs’ (IDC) subsidy and the ‘percentage depletion’ subsidy—increased the expected value of new oil and gas projects by upwards of USD 20bn over the past two decades (Erickson, 2021). Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which incentivises the build out of renewable energy, simultaneously enables the expansion of oil and gas production by mandating new leases on public lands for fossil fuel projects (see below on new auctions and project approvals) (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023).

(Kühne et al., 2022)(Climate Trace, 2023; Lu et al., 2023)To keep 1.5°C of warming within reach, GHG emissions must be halved globally by 2030 and no new oil and gas should be developed (IEA, 2023b; IPCC, 2022). Therefore, the planned investments in - and developments of new - oil and gas infrastructure in the US obstruct progress towards the global 1.5°C temperature target, as well as the country’s 2030 climate target and 2050 net zero target, and will likely lead to significant stranded assets in a Paris Agreement-compatible future.

New fossil fuel auctions and project approvals

Beyond the IRA’s incentives for clean energy production and investment, the act also provides notable concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The act offers these compromises under the pretence of allowing domestic oil and gas companies to transition away from fossil fuels at a reasonable pace.

The IRA requires the federal government to offer an annual minimum area of specified public lands for drilling. While the act does increase the royalty rates paid by companies for extracting fossil fuels on public lands, it also requires prioritisation of oil and gas auctions over renewable energy on federal lands and offshore developments.

These provisions not only contradict President Biden’s promise to end new federal fossil fuel leasing of public lands, but also increases the risk of locking in fossil fuel infrastructure and creating stranded assets during the energy transition. Although the Biden Administration has already reached its 2025 target for renewable energy deployment on public lands (Groom, 2024), the continued leasing of public lands for oil and gas extraction sends a long-term signal to the fossil fuel industry that may slow the pace of emissions reductions over the coming decades.

The result of new fossil fuel leasing under the IRA has been the approval of several large oil and gas projects on public lands. In March 2023, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) gave its formal approval for the ConocoPhillips Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, which is the largest approved oil and gas project in the country (Chu, 2024). Although the DOI significantly reduced the scope of the project, the Willow Project is one of the few oil projects that the Biden Administration approved without a congressional or court mandate (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023b).

The approval of the project breaks Biden’s promise to stop new oil drilling on federal land and will result in significant environmental and biodiversity impacts. The project has the potential to produce over 600 million barrels of crude oil over the next 30 years, which will release nearly 280 MtCO2e in emissions (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 2023).

The Biden Administration auctioned off 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, more than double the size of the Willow Project, for offshore oil and gas drilling. The auction generated over USD 260m, the highest bid total since 2017. While the auctioning of these offshore sites was a mandatory provision under the IRA, the government had the ability to reduce the size and scope of the sale but chose not to (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023).

In July 2023, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline to proceed. The pipeline is a 500-km-long project that will transport fossil gas from West Virginia to Virginia. The pipeline was subject to multiple lawsuits and a complex environmental permitting process as the planned pipeline would cross waterways and national forest lands. The project’s approval came after a bipartisan group of lawmakers filed an emergency request to include the project in the debt ceiling negotiations, which eliminates the ability to challenge the pipeline in court (AP News, 2023; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2023).

In September 2023, the government published new, stricter rules for offshore oil and gas leasing as part of the next iteration of its offshore leasing programme for 2024–2029 (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023). During this five-year period, only three areas of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned to fossil fuel companies. The drafting of the updated leasing programme was delayed by litigation from several states, oil and gas companies, and environmental groups (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2022).

State-level action to end fossil fuel production

California is the only oil and gas producing state that has moved to end production. The state banned new fracking permits from 2024 and plans to phase out oil production by 2045. California is a founding associate member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which was introduced at COP26. Washington state joined BOGA at COP27 in 2022 and has implemented measures to ban new fossil infrastructure, including oil refineries (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021, 2022). The US did not join BOGA at its founding at COP26 and has since not joined the alliance.

Abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells: a lasting legacy of carbon pollution

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes a USD 21bn investment to plug and clean up abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells, which continue to emit significant amounts of methane and other pollutants long after remission (U.S. Senate, 2021). This investment was increased by USD 5bn by the Biden Administration after its negotiation in the US Congress.

In August 2022, the DOI awarded USD 560m to 24 states to begin work on monitoring and capping methane emissions from orphaned oil and gas wells (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2022). This initiative is further supported through the IRA’s Methane Emissions Reductions Program, under which the Biden Administration announced an additional USD 350m in the first of a series of grants for states to measure and reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The programme includes funding for plugging and cleaning up abandoned well sites (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022f).


## Industry

Direct GHG emissions from industry accounted for 23% of total US emissions in 2023, making it the third largest contributor to US GHG emissions after the transport and electricity sectors.

In 2020, emissions from the industrial sector decreased by 6% due the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, sectoral emissions increased by 1% as a result of the economy’s recovery. In 2022, emissions remained stable, indicating that the sector’s emissions have not reached pre-pandemic levels again (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n).

Industrial emissions have remained largely stable over the past decade, even as the US economy has transitioned from a manufacturing to a service-based economy and as industrial processes have experienced efficiency improvements and shifted to less emissions-intensive fuels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n). Under current policies, emissions from the industrial sector are projected to remain stable or minimally decrease as a result of the counteracting forces of renewed growth in domestic manufacturing and strengthen decarbonisation policies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (King, Kolus, et al., 2024; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA funds several measures to decarbonise the industrial sector. The act provides USD 5.8bn in funding for the new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. In 2024, this programme selected, and began awarding financing to, projects in emissions-intensive industrial facilities (e.g. iron, steel, concrete sectors). The DOE estimates that the programme will reduce 14 MtCO2 annually (Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, 2024).

The IRA also expands tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and sequestration (CCUS) technology, building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s (BIL) investments in CCUS demonstrations and industrial applications (The White House, 2023b; U.S. Department of Energy, 2022d). Estimates suggest that measures under the IRA for industrial CCUS might reduce up to 240MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

The IRA includes the Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides tax credits for industrial and manufacturing facilities that invest in certain clean energy technologies. Eligible facilities either must re-tool with equipment designed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20%, re-equip, expand, or establish measures for producing and recycling clean energy equipment, or process, refine, and recycle critical materials (The White House, 2023b). A total of USD 10bn in tax credits was allocated in a first round. A second round in 2024 aims to allocate an additional USD 6bn (IRS, 2024; U.S. Department of Energy, 2024g).

The US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development of technologies that are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.

The challenging economics of many technologies in the industrial sector, such as green hydrogen and CCUS, require clear, robust incentive schemes to de-risk and attract investment (Department of Energy, 2024). Individual products, such as clean and/or green steel, might otherwise still find niche market applications (e.g. via government procurement), but will likely not be sufficiently commercialised to enable a full sector decarbonisation.

In March 2023, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalised its Good Neighbour Plan, which requires industrial facilities and power plants in 23 states to cut NOx emissions to prevent pollution across state lines. By 2026, the EPA plans to set enforceable NOx emissions control requirements, which will primarily reduce emissions from harmful air pollutants and also reduce CO2 emissions by 16 MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

In December 2020, the US Congress enacted legislation under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act to tackle hydrofluorocarbon emissions (HFC). The act directs the EPA to phase down the production and imports of HFCs by 85% until 2036. It is expected to reduce emissions by 4.7 GtCO2e by 2050 via sector-based requirements to transition to non-HFC-emitting alternatives and next-generation technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b).

In 2024, the US met its HFC phase-down target of reducing HFCs by 40% below 2020 levels (Haroldsen, 2024). The IRA provides an additional USD 38.5m to the EPA to implement the AIM Act (The White House, 2023b). We incorporate the IRA's effects on reducing non-CO2 emissions into our current policy projections through a review of studies that quantify this impact (see Assumptions section).

Hydrogen plays a central role in the Biden Administration’s roadmap for decarbonising hard-to-abate industrial processes and replacing fossil fuel-based feedstock with cleaner alternatives. The IRA established the Hydrogen Production Tax Credit to incentivise domestic production of clean hydrogen and to meet the Biden Administration’s Hydrogen Shot target, which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to USD 1 per kilogram through 2030 (The White House, 2023b). Recently, the credit has received criticism for its requirements to minimise emissions from hydrogen production, which certain actors argue are too costly (Pontecorvo, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, the transport sector accounted for 28.5% of total US GHG emissions and, since 2017, has been the largest contributor. Total sector emissions increased by 19.4% between 1990 and 2022 due to increased motorised transport demand: during the same period, the average number of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) per passenger cars and light-duty trucks increased by 46.7%. Road transport is responsible for the vast majority of transport sector emissions in the US: light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks and passenger cars accounted for 79.8% of total sectoral emissions in 2022 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes several components to decarbonise the transport sector, such as investments to improve roads, modernise public transit, and boost the electric vehicle (EV) market (U.S. Senate, 2021). The BIL includes measures to develop EV charging stations (USD 7.5 bn), strengthen the country’s EV battery supply chain (USD 7bn), update and upgrade public transportation (USD 39bn), build out ‘climate-friendly’ passenger and freight railways (USD 66bn), and invest in roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure projects (USD 110bn), as well as in clean busses and ferries (USD 7.5bn).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), alongside significant investments in electrifying light- and heavy-duty vehicles (see below), provides considerable financial support for EV manufacturing and supply chains: the IRA sets aside USD 2bn for the Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant Program, which funds the re-tooling of production lines for EVs. The act allocates another USD 3bn for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which has expanded coverage to heavy-duty vehicles, locomotives, maritime vessels, and planes. As a result, plans for 163 new battery and 117 EV manufacturing plants have been announced.

If fully realised, these plants would create over 170,000 new jobs in battery and EV manufacturing and account for over 60% of all new jobs created by the IRA (Climate Power, 2024b). By 2030, if all planned manufacturing plants are operationalised, domestic battery manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by nearly 20 times to approximately 1000 GWh/year relative to 55 GWh/year in 2021 (U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2023).

The IRA also extends the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit to spur the domestic production and sale of clean energy components, including certain EV-relevant battery components and critical minerals (The White House, 2023b). Through these measures, the IRA is expected to reduce transport sector emissions by 15%–35% by 2035 relative to 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). In combination with existing policies and the BIL, the IRA is estimated to reduce overall GHG emissions by 1,150 MtCO2e in 2030 in comparison to business-as-usual scenarios; the result is that GHG emissions are forecasted to be 40% lower in 2030 than in 2005 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022e).

In January 2023, the Biden Administration released its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation to support the 2050 economy-wide net zero target and the 2050 target of 80%–100% emissions reductions in the transport sector. The blueprint's three key strategies align with the Avoid, Shift, and Improve (ASI) framework: the strategy supports community design and land-use planning, expands access to more efficient public and private transport, and facilitates the transition to zero emission vehicles and fuels (U.S. Department of Energy et al., 2023).

The modal split for passenger transport has been and continues to be dominated by road transport. In 2022, nearly 70% of all commutes were undertaken by single-occupancy vehicles, while only approximately 9% of commuters carpooled. The share of single-occupancy vehicle commutes decreased by over 10% between 2018 to 2022. During the same period, and likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of the population working from home increased by nearly 10%. In 2022, approximately 6% of commuters used public transport and engaged active mobility (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2022).

In March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised its Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles. The standards, which will phase in from 2027 through 2032, set fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets for auto manufacturers. For light-duty vehicles, the fleet-wide average target is 170 CO2 grams/mile in 2027. By 2032, the average target for light-duty fleets will be reduced to 85 CO2 grams/mile (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i).

To meet the 2032 target, the EPA estimates that battery electric vehicles will account for 30–56% of automaker's fleets to meet the average emissions target (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024j). The resulting emissions reductions are approximated to total 7.2bn tons of CO2 through 2055 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024b).

The efforts are somewhat undermined by the fact that medium-duty vehicles—a vehicle segment that includes vans and pickup trucks and represented nearly 20% of the total US light- and medium-duty vehicle fleet in 2021—are subject to a different, less demanding set of emission standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a).

Although the updated standards are the most stringent in US history, the standards are less ambitious than equivalent regulations in the EU and the UK, where the emissions target for 2035 is 0 CO2 grams/mile for new light-duty vehicles (The International Council on Clean Transportation, 2024). The relative weakness of the US standards may be partially attributable to lobbying efforts from auto manufacturers. The EPA initially proposed more ambitious fleet-wide average targets between 2027 and 2032, but the auto lobby, spearheaded by Toyota's push for more flexibility in achieving the emissions targets, successfully watered down the standards (Tabuchi, 2024). In doing so, auto manufacturers can continue to fulfil their emission reduction targets with ICE-based vehicles, which prolongs the production and profitability of fossil fuel-powered vehicles and obstructs a faster transition towards a decarbonised transport sector.

At the state level, stricter, more ambitious EV policy has been implemented. California established a 100% EV sales target for 2035 through its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation in 2023. This regulation has been duplicated and adopted by twelve other states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) (California Air Resources Board, 2024). As a result, over one-third of all light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales in the US are subject to the 2035 100% EV sales target (IEA, 2024b).

The combined sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles made up 16.3% of all new LDV sales in the US in 2023. Battery electric vehicles accounted for approximately 7% of new car sales in the US in 2023; BEV sales reached a record of 1.1 million in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a).

The growth in BEV sales is the result of a larger selection and significant price cuts in vehicles: in 2023, 20 new BEV models were introduced, while the average transaction price for BEVs decreased by over 17% between December 2022 and December 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the gap in average transaction price between BEVs and ICE-based vehicles decreased to a record low of USD 7,000 before any purchase incentives are applied (Doll, 2024; Kelley Blue Book, 2023; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a). This means that, once government incentives are applied, certain BEVs are as or more affordable than their ICE counterparts. Beyond increases in availability and affordability, growing consumer interest and IRA incentives continue to further augmented uptake (Inside EVs, 2023).

To reduce emissions from road transport, the government set a goal for 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles (The White House, 2021d). However, this 50% target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement. To be compatible with the PA, research suggests that 95–100% of sales of new LDVs in the US should be zero-emissions by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).

Even with IRA support, the US government estimates that LDV EV sales will only reach a median of 36% in 2030 (with a range of 15%–54%) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c), which is insufficient to meet the Biden Administration's goal, let alone to meet the 1.5°C compatible benchmark (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

It is important to note that estimates for EV uptake vary substantially. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2023 estimates that the US will achieve the EV sales target of 50% by 2030 under the STEPS scenario and the International Council on Clean Transportation anticipates the LDV EV sales share will reach 48%–61% in 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c). At the same time, recent US Energy Information Agency (EIA) calculations only project 13–29% EV sales in 2050 (IEA, 2023a; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023i).

The US did not sign the 100% EVs declaration at COP26. Signatories agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles (Race to Zero, 2021). Despite the absence of the federal government’s signature, many US subnational and non-state actors, including states, cities, and automakers, signed the declaration (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021a).

In March 2024, the Biden Administration, building on the set of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration in 2018, increased tariffs on a range of decarbonisation-relevant products and technologies from China. Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles increased the most: the border tax on EVs will quadruple from 25% to 100% of the import value (Tankersley & Rappeport, 2024). Although politically significant, research indicates that economic impacts will likely be limited (Sherman, 2024). In September 2024, the Biden Adminsitration, citing national security concerns, proposed a ban on all Chinese connected car hardware and software (Shepardson et al., 2024). If finalised, Chinese software would be banned starting in 2026, while hardware would be prohibited beginning in 2030.

The IRA accelerates the uptake of electric light-duty vehicles by extending and expanding tax credits for both new and used EVs. From 2023 through 2032, the Clean Vehicle Credit provides up to USD 7,500 for new battery electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell EVs that retail under USD 80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and USD 55,000 for all other types of vehicles. To qualify for the full credit, the vehicle and its critical mineral and battery components must meet certain requirements for assembly in and sourcing from North America or trusted trade partners (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024a). The result of the sourcing and manufacturing requirements is that only 22 EV models qualified for the total tax credit out of the 104 EV models for sale in May 2024 (Lambert, 2024).

Beyond targeting new EV sales, the US government seeks to leverage the maturing used electric vehicle market, which was made up of approximately 400,000 EVs in 2023 (IEA, 2024b): the Used Clean Vehicles Credit provides up to USD 4,000 to buyers who purchase a used electric vehicle for USD 25,000 or less (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024c).

Both the credits for new and used EVs are capped at different income levels to increase the affordability of and access to EVs for individuals and households with lower to middle incomes. Buyers of used EVs can also claim the credit at the time of purchase, which more immediately reduces the purchasing or monthly financing cost. As high costs remain a crucial barrier to EV adoption, reducing costs, particularly for buyers with lower incomes, accelerates and supports a just transition to EVs (Pamidimukkala et al., 2023).

The government is on track to achieve its 2030 target for 500,000 publicly accessible recharging points in 2026 (The White House, 2024a). The number of publicly accessible recharging points increased by over 70% to 170,000 stations since 2021 (U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, 2024).(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023i)

Freight transport emissions account for an increasing share of total transport emissions in the US: the share of emissions from freight transport increased from 24% in 1990 to 32% in 2021 (K. Kennedy, 2023). Trucking accounted for 65% of all freight moved by weight and made up roughly 83% of total freight transport emissions in 2021 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024f).

To mitigate emissions from trucking, the government revised emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2024 (see below). Shifting freight transport to rail, which only emitted 5.7% of total sectoral emissions in 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2023) and accounted for the greatest share of long-distance freight volumes across all modes of freight transport, has significant emissions reductions potential (Association of American Railroads, 2021).

In March 2024, the EPA adopted an updated set of vehicle emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, transit, and vocational vehicles. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles Phase 3 strengths the existing emissions standards: heavy-duty vocational vehicles need to reduce emissions by up to 60% more under the Phase 3 standards relative to Phase 2.

The revised standards will effect HDVs starting in 2027 through 2032. Between 2027 and 2055, the standards are expected to mitigate approximately 1bn tons of CO2 emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024e). In comparison, the EU, which also revised its heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards in 2024, sets a more ambitious emissions reductions target for all new HDVs for 2030, which will escalate to a 90% target for 2040.

As a first step to mainstream reductions in freight transport emissions, the Biden Administration established a national goal to transition towards a zero-emissions freight sector in April 2024. Although the administration has not indicated an explicit timeline for the zero-emissions target, separate action plans for decarbonising truck, rail, aviation, and marine freight transport are to be developed.

Since its adoption in 2022, the IRA has spurred investments and introduced provisions to reduce GHG emissions from heavy-duty transport. Through the IRA, the EPA launched the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle Program, which was revised in 2024, to provide USD 1bn in grants to states, municipalities, and Tribes to offset the costs of replacing heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emissions alternatives and installing related infrastructure; at least USD 400m of the total funding will be channelled towards communities suffering from severe air pollution (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024d). The programme's first funding round of over USD 900m opened in April 2024 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024c). The EPA estimates that 70% of the programmes funding will go towards replacing ICE-based school buses (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024a). An additional USD 3bn is allocated to provide grants to local governments, port authorities, and other relevant actors to purchase and install zero-emission port equipment and technology (The White House, 2023b).

The IRA has also introduced the Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, which defers 30% of the costs of replacing diesel or gas-powered commercial vehicles—ranging from cars to long-haul trucks —with electric vehicles. A credit of up to 15% is also available when replacing a vehicle with a partially electric alternative. The IRA also allocates USD 3bn for electrifying the United States Postal Service fleet (The White House, 2023b).

Beyond providing tax credits for buyers, the government is partnering with truck manufacturers to further develop heavy-duty EV technologies. Through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, the Supertruck 3 programme, and the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium, the US Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting the research and development of next generation of heavy-duty batteries and fuel cells (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022a).

The government is also funding commercial EV demonstration projects. In 2023, the DOE awarded over USD 7m to seven projects that will develop a medium- and heavy-duty recharging station corridor across 23 states. In 2024, the government announced that the DOE would fund the research and development of load management strategies to alleviate recharging-related grid capacity challenges.

Federal government support for commercial EV uptake has been supplemented by state action. New York and California provide additional purchase incentives of over USD 100,000 on top of the IRA’s mechanism. In response, adoption of heavy-duty EVs seems to be increasing: delivery van fleets are quickly electrifying as Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Walmart place major EV orders. Commercial production by Volvo and Freightliner of electric tractor trailers, or 18-wheelers, began in 2023.

Although there are promising signs of increasing implementation, only 1.5% of all commercial heavy-duty vehicles in the US were BEVs or PHEVs in September 2023. At the same point in time, the share of BEVs and PHEVs in the HDV fleets in Europe and China amounted to over 7% and 10%, respectively (Soulopoulos, 2023).

The IRA also seeks to encourage the development and adoption of sustainable fuel technologies in the aviation industry. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit incentivises the sale and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) that reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

The tax credit, worth USD 1.25 per gallon, is progressive: SAF that reduce emissions by more than 50% are eligible for an additional USD 0.01 per gallon for each extra percent that the reduction exceeds 50% (up to USD 0.50 per gallon) (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022c). The act additionally provides nearly USD 300m in grants to develop and deploy projects related to sustainable aviation fuel and low-emission aviation technologies (The White House, 2023b).

Although the US produced nearly 16m gallons of SAF in 2022, these fuels accounted for less than 0.1% of the total fuel used by US airlines in the same year (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2023). Additionally, analysis suggests that currently available SAF do not reduce emissions across the fuels’ full lifecycles given their emissions and agricultural resource-intensive production methods (Lashof & Denvir, 2024).


## Buildings

In 2022, direct GHG emissions from buildings accounted for 13.5% percent of total US GHG emissions; 7.3% of the sector’s emissions came from commercial buildings and 6.2% from residential buildings. When accounting for indirect, electricity-related emissions, the buildings sector made up almost one-third (31.1%) of the country’s total GHG emissions in 2022. Since 2005, total emissions—the combination of direct and indirect emissions—from residential and commercial buildings have decreased by approximately 25%. However, direct emissions from buildings have remained nearly constant since 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024g).

The Biden Administration aims to reduce emissions from buildings by 65% in 2035 and by 90% in 2050 compared to 2005 emissions levels. However, to be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT estimates that emissions from buildings in the US should already be 60% lower in residential buildings and 70% lower in commercial buildings by 2030 compared to 2015 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021a, 2021b). Achieving these levels of emissions reductions requires the complete phase-out of new fossil fuel-based energy supply installations in buildings and the rapid retrofitting of the existing housing stock to improve energy efficiency.

Developing and implementing building codes is largely the responsibility of state and local authorities. The federal government’s ability to regulate emissions from buildings is limited; the federal government can directly regulate federal buildings and, otherwise, can only provide financial support and technical guidance for state and local governments.

In April 2024, the US Department of Energy (DOE) released a national strategy to guide the decarbonisation of the building sector by 2050, which emphasises the federal government’s role in coordinating and supporting subnational governments in reaching this target (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a). The strategy outlines key actions, performance targets, and barriers to increase building energy efficiency, accelerate on-site emissions reductions, transform the grid edge, and minimise embodied lifecycle emissions.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes USD 225m for state and local implementation of energy codes. Albeit limited in comparison with other funding allocations under the BIL, these resources have largely gone towards the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation programme to support energy code adoption, enforcement, training, and technical assistance at the subnational level. In 2022, the DOE released a new building energy code for federal buildings that aims to improve energy efficiency (The White House, 2022b).

The Biden Administration’s National Initiative to Advance Building Codes unlocked USD 1bn in IRA grants to further support state and local governments in the adoption of the latest building codes and energy efficiency standards. The initiative aims to provide technical and financial support to state and local governments to modernise building codes in underserved communities, to enhance resilience to increasingly severe weather impacts, to increase household savings on utility bills, and, in turn, to further reduce residential GHG emissions.

In June 2024, the DOE released its National Definition for a Zero Emissions Building (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024e). According to the definition, a net zero energy building (nZEB) must be highly energy efficient, cannot emit greenhouse gases on-site, and is powered entirely by clean energy. It is important to note that this definition is not a binding, regulatory standard. Instead, the definition is intended to support and guide public and private sectors in decarbonising new and existing commercial and residential buildings.

At the state level, only California and Massachusetts have set targets for nZEBs in their building codes (Massachusetts State, 2022; State of California Public Utilities Commission, 2021). Due to its limited jurisdiction regarding building codes, the federal government has only set a net zero target for federal buildings (see federal buildings section below). In contrast, the EU, which is similarly legally constrained in implementing building codes, requires Member States to set domestic regulations for all new buildings to be zero emissions by 2030 and for the entire building stock to be zero emissions by 2050.

Given that the average lifetime of residential buildings is over 60 years (Aktas & Bilec, 2012), renovating and converting existing buildings into nZEBs is key to mitigating emissions from the sector. To encourage net zero renovations, the federal government provides financial incentives. However, the government does not clearly define or provide guidance on the process of converting buildings to net zero structures. In comparison, the EU provides a step-by-step, long-term guide for deep, net zero renovations through its Building Renovation Passport; the guidelines make the renovation process more accessible to homeowners and, in turn, expediate the transition to nZEBs (European Commision, 2024).

As it stands, the decarbonisation of buildings in the US will mainly rely on financial incentives for energy efficiency improvements, which, as a result, may have to rely heavily on the electrification of buildings and put more pressure on the power sector. Modelling work by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hints at the building sector’s dependency on electrification for decarbonisation: under the IRA, total emissions from buildings will decrease significantly by 2035 as the share of electricity in final energy consumption is expected to increase by nearly 5% between 2025 and 2035 (in contrast, to an increase of only 2% in the absence of the IRA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023a). At the same time, direct emissions from fuel combustion will likely remain stable; indicating that reductions in total emissions seem to be driven by a decrease in indirect, end-use electricity emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023c).

Through the BIL, the government allocated USD 3bn to support energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in homes (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022g). The 2022 IRA builds on the BIL by unlocking nearly USD 9bn for states and Tribes to support consumer home energy rebate programmes; specifically, for programmes related to retrofitting buildings and purchasing high-efficiency electronic appliances in lower-income communities (The White House, 2023b).

The incentives aim to simultaneously reduce energy costs for homeowners and emissions from residential buildings. Via IRA funding, households that retrofit their homes and reduce energy use by at least 35% are eligible for a tax rebate worth USD 4,000. Multifamily structures can qualify for up to USD 400,000.

To further incentivise home energy improvements, the government provides tax rebates for energy efficiency upgrades, such as for installing heat pumps, insulation, doors, and windows, and for investing in residential clean energy, including rooftop solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024b).

Beyond supporting residential building upgrades, the IRA targets energy use in commercial buildings by providing tax deductions for buildings that increase their energy efficiency by at least 25% (The White House, 2023b). The BIL introduced the Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program (RLF), which channels USD 250m to states to establish revolving loan funds. With these funds, states can provide loans, grants, and technical assistance for energy upgrades and retrofits in commercial and residential buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022b, 2024d).

Embodied life-cycle carbon emissions of construction and building materials are a significant contributor to GHG emissions: embodied carbon is estimated to make up approximately 14% of building emissions (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a) and as much as 6% of total national emissions (Huynh et al., 2023).

However, there is a lack of standardised, high-quality data on embodied emissions and the federal government does not publicly release data on such emissions. Nevertheless, the government, under the IRA, has taken steps to reduce embodied emissions in buildings. In 2023, the IRA allocates USD 100m to develop standardised labels for lower-embodied carbon building materials, as well as USD 2.15bn for 150 construction projects that employ types of asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel with low embodied carbon (Chase, 2024).

Energy efficiency standards for consumer products and appliances in the US are generally ambitious; a 2023 review of the stringency of minimum energy performance standards determined that the federal government’s energy standards for electric motors, refrigerators, and water heaters meet or exceed international best practice (Mavandad & Malinowski, 2023).

The EPA’s voluntary energy efficiency labelling programme, ENERGY STAR, supports the government’s efficiency standards. The programme labels efficient products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and, in 2020, is estimated to have reduced emissions by 400 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to a 5% reduction in total national emissions (ENERGY STAR, 2023).

In 2022, the Biden Administration took over 100 actions to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a broad range of products, including household products and appliances, as well as commercial and industrial equipment. The updated standards will reduce GHG emissions by an estimated 2.4 GtCO2e over the next 30 years, or around 80 MtCO2e/year (The White House, 2022c).

In 2023 and 2024, the DOE finalised new standards for refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners and cleaners, and clothes washers and dryers. In combination, these new standards are expected to reduce emissions by an average of 19.9 MtCO2e/year over the next 30 years (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023b, 2023a, 2024c). In total, the revised standards for these products will reduce household and business energy costs by USD 8.7bn per year.

The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US and federal buildings are a principal source of the government’s emissions (Council on Environmental Quality, 2024). In April 2024, the DOE amended its energy performance standards for the new construction and renovation of federal buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024b). The revised standards explicitly require federal buildings to reduce the use of fossil fuels. According to the standards, federal agencies must reduce their fossil fuel use in new construction and major renovation projects by 90% between FY2025 and FY2029. The standards mandate that the on-site use of fossil fuels is eliminated by 2030 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024f).

In 2021, President Biden established through Executive Order numerous targets for federal operations and procurement, including reaching net zero emissions in the federal buildings portfolio by 2045 and reducing federal buildings emissions by 50% by 2032 (The White House, 2021c). In 2022, the Biden Administration issued implementing instructions on the Executive Order, which detailed the agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability mechanism to achieve such targets (The White House Council on Environmental Quality, 2022).


## Agriculture

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9% of US emissions in 2022. Between 1990 and 2022, agriculture emissions increased by 8%, primarily from the growth of the livestock sector and the intensification of farming practices. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils made up half of agricultural emissions. Enteric fermentation and manure management from livestock represented other significant emissions sources.

Agricultural emissions decreased in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, this decrease was not the result of new policy, but is rather attributable to the decline in herd size—the smallest since the 1960s—due to drought conditions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates USD 19.5bn for mitigation activities in the agriculture sector. The act mainly boosts the funding of existing conservation programmes, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) (Monke et al., 2022).

Both programmes offer financial and technical support to farmers to implement climate-friendly practices, including nutrient management, cover crops, low or no-tillage, and agroforestry. Historically, farmers have struggled to access funding under such programmes due to high demand and limited institutional capacity. These barriers could potentially be addressed by better distributing programme spending (e.g. by capping funds per farm), limiting the funding that goes to ineffective conservation practices, and increasing agency resources (Happ, 2023; Tham, 2023).

However, the efficacy of existing programmes to address on-farm emissions has come into question. Between 2019 and 2020, only one-fifth of total EQIP spending reportedly went towards the implementation of agricultural practices that directly reduce GHG emissions (Schechinger, 2022). While programmes like EQIP and CSP are now bolstered by IRA funding, they still face structural issues that may impede climate mitigation.

In 2024, 15 new practices were added to the 'climate-smart' category under the EQIP, but many of the new measures do not have proven climate benefits. A significant portion of EQIP funding goes towards manure management practices, including biodigesters that convert manure into biogas, which can be sold for profit and, therefore, may incentivise farmers to maintain or increase their herd sizes (Happ, 2024; Schechinger, 2024).

The IRA has also funded several programmes to support renewable energy use in the agriculture sector, including loans and grants for farmers who implement energy efficient equipment or underutilised renewable energy technologies (The White House, 2023b). However, certain provisions of these programmes could lead to perverse incentives. For instance, the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) subsidises biogas production. However, in combination with existing state subsidies for cattle farmers to produce biomass, REAP’s subsidies could lead to intensified livestock production (Sainato, 2022).

The Farm Bill is a policy that heavily influences farmers’ decisions on what food to produce and how to produce it. The 2018 bill expired last year, but was temporarily extended through FY2024. Its official renewal was pushed to 2024 since Congress could not come to an agreement on the contents of the new bill.

In 2024, the Republican-led House Committee on Agriculture released a draft bill that could deter climate progress in the agriculture sector. The bill would reallocate up to USD 14.4bn from the IRA that is specifically meant for climate-friendly farming practices to cover all conservation practices. The bill would also reinstate the requirement that 50% of EQIP funds are channelled to livestock operations (House Committee on Agriculture, 2024). However, the fate of the Farm Bill and its contents remain unclear as it has yet to arrive on the House floor.

There are still considerable policy gaps in addressing agricultural emissions. Beyond the structural issues of existing programmes (i.e. EQIP, CSP), the US lacks regulations or plans for addressing emissions from animal production. There are no incentives for reducing the volume of animal agriculture or for promoting plant-based foods and crops (CBD, 2020). Instead, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), which are detrimental to animal and environmental welfare, continue to be subsidised by the government (Happ, 2024).

The government also lacks policies on the demand-side. The US has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world, but food consumption patterns have not been addressed by the government. Historically, the meat industry has lobbied against key demand-side policies, such as changes to dietary guidelines, which constitute the basis of federal nutrition programmes and policy (Bottemiller Evich, 2016; Sebastian, 2024). Without a shift in diets, related emissions may increase by 9% in the US as a result of population growth (Heller et al., 2020).

The volume of food waste in the US is very high. Approximately one-third of available food is lost or wasted. Surplus, wasted food results in significant embodied emissions across the supply chain, and has been estimated to account for 6% of the country’s total GHG emissions (Harwood et al., 2023). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a goal to halve food loss and waste by 2030.

However, the target puts little focus on food losses, which occur during the production and processing stages, due to a lack of data (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o). The US is not on track to reach this target due to insufficient federal and state-level policies. Interventions to prevent food waste, such as policies on date labels, are insufficient. At the subnational level, some states hinder the recycling of food waste through bans on diverting food waste streams towards animal feed (ReFED, 2024).


## Forestry

In 2022, the net CO2 removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector corresponded to roughly 15% of total US GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, net carbon removals in the sector decreased by 13% due to the declining rate of net carbon accumulation in forests and on cropland, as well as an increase in emissions from urbanisation (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h).

Maintaining and increasing the carbon sink is an important component of the US government’s NDC and net zero targets. The government is a signatory of COP26’s forestry pledge, and the New York Declaration of Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030, improve and expanding forest finance and governance, and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Forest Declaration Platform, 2022).

Although the government has pledged to preserve and expand its natural carbon sink in its national policies and international negotiations, a recent study published by the US Forest Service raises concerns about the potential of US forests to store carbon in the long term. A decrease in forest area from land conversion, an increased demand for timber products, and a higher frequency of natural disturbances from climate change are reducing the ability of US aging forests to sequester carbon. Under a high wood demand scenario, US forests could even become a carbon source by 2070 (U.S. Forest Service, 2023).

To circumvent such risks, the US needs more robust forest management practices and policies. Current afforestation rates are insufficient to maintain current levels of CO2 removal, let alone meet the values presented in the government’s long-term strategy (LTS). Further incentives are needed to expand forest area, which is especially challenging on private lands (Wear & Wibbenmeyer, 2023).

Although afforestation has the largest potential to improve the carbon sink, more can be done to increase the average carbon stocks of managed forests, such as extending harvests or rotation ages. Increased investments in fire suppression and post-wildfire reforestation are necessary to mitigate wildfires and reduce their severity, which is exacerbated by climate change (S. Kennedy et al., 2024).

In 2020, then-President Trump reversed a long-standing rule that limited logging in the largest national forest, Alaska’s Tongass National Forest. The Biden Administration reinstated the protections on the forest in January 2023 by banning road-building and logging on the majority of the forest’s 16 million acres (Friedman, 2023). Considering that the Tongass makes up over one-fifth of the nation’s forest carbon stocks, its protection is critical to preserving the considerable US carbon sink (Dellasala et al., 2022).

The IRA has led to further investments (USD 5bn) in the National Forest Service and programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities. This includes grants for urban and community tree planting efforts, technical and financial assistance for landowners to boost carbon sequestration on forestland, and support for existing programmes (The White House, 2023b).

The Forest Legacy Program identifies and conserves environmentally significant forest areas that are threatened by land conversion through economic incentives. Landowners can either sell their property to the government or use a conservation easement. The programme has conserved over 3 million acres of forest land since 1990 (U.S. Forest Service, n.d.).

On the other hand, the IRA has introduced some tax measures that could drive biomass production and accelerate logging if inputs are not well-managed. Certain tax incentives for clean energy production and subsidies for advanced manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for carbon capture technologies, could be used by bioenergy companies to boost their production of forest biomass (e.g. wood pellets). The Treasury Department has not yet defined what ‘clean energy’ refers to under such provisions (Bruggers, 2024).

The US Forest Service has separate timber production targets that are highly misaligned with its responsibility to preserve and increase the carbon sink (Talbott, 2024). The agency wants to increase timber production by 25% above current levels, which is higher than any period in the past few decades (U.S. Forest Service, 2022).

The agency cites some of the reinstated protections on old-growth forests as a barrier to increased logging, and also identifies logging in regions critical to preserving high-carbon forests, such as the Pacific Northwest, as key to meeting the target (U.S. Forest Service, 2022)(Talbott, 2024). To reach the net LULUCF emissions removals needed to meet US climate targets, climate mitigation should be prioritised over timber production.


## Waste

The waste sector made up only 2.7% of national emissions in 2021 but contributed to 17% of anthropogenic methane emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). Therefore, addressing methane emissions from landfills is a key pillar of the US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. In 2021, the Biden Administration finalised emissions standards to ensure that large municipal landfills significantly reduce their methane emissions, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a Landfill Methane Outreach Program to support methane collection and distribution at smaller, unregulated landfills (The White House, 2021b).

The IRA has not led to significant policies or programmes in the waste sector, aside from some funding to improve methane monitoring and to develop a better method to measure fugitive methane sources (e.g. landfills) (The White House, 2023b).

Recently, the EPA has been sued by environmental groups for failing to update its landfill emissions accounting methodology, which it has not revised since 1998. The current emissions factors reportedly underestimate the emissions released from landfills from several pollutants, including nitrogen oxide, by as much as 25%. As a result of the lawsuit, the EPA has agreed to evaluate whether methodology needs updating and to suggest new emissions factors in case updating is required (Quinn, 2023).


## Methane

Methane is an important source of GHG emissions in the US, representing 15% of total GHG emissions in 2022, which are split between the oil and gas industry (37%), agriculture (36%), waste (19%), and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (8%) sectors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o).

Alongside the EU, the US spearheaded the launch of the Global Methane Pledge. The Biden Administration released its Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan in 2021. The plan seeks to reduce emissions from all major sources through regulations, financial incentives, and public-private partnerships.

The plan also includes USD 20bn in new investments targeted at reducing methane emissions (The White House, 2022a). The IRA provided USD 1.5bn for the Methane Emissions Reduction Fund, which aims to monitor and reduce emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems through financial and technical assistance, but also potentially locks in new “brown” infrastructure. It also established a ‘waste emissions charge’ per ton of methane emissions to oil and gas facilities that exceed emissions thresholds (The White House, 2023b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions are based on the 1990–2022 inventory emissions developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). The national inventory was reported in AR5 Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. We converted all values to AR4 GWP.


## NDC and other targets

For the 2030 NDC target, we apply the indicated target of 50%–52% reduction to the 2005 base year including LULUCF, and then subtract the projected emissions for the LULUCF sector. The LULUCF emission projections in 2030 were taken from the 5th Biennial Report which reported sinks of 0.6–0.8 GtCO2e/year in 2030 (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

For the net zero target, we assume total GHG emissions in 2050 are balanced by projected sinks in 2050. The LULUCF sinks in 2050 were taken from the US long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Since the document does not provide exact figures, we have extracted the approximated figures from the graphs in the report. The reading of the graphs results in an approximation of minus 0.6-1.4 GtCO2e/year for LULUCF sinks in 2050, we add this sink to the residual estimate in 2050 to get 0.6-1.5 GtCO2e/year in 2050. We include also estimates for 2040 in our pathway using a similar approach.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections were generated in five steps:

- First, we estimate the total emissions projections under current policies as the aggregation of the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors:GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical, and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.
- Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.
- Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).
- All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.
- GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical, and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook—the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario—to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).

- GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- Second, each of the above emissions categories was harmonised to historical data for each sector by applying the estimated annual percentage change from the projected dataset to the base year. The projections for all sectors were then aggregated to obtain total GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF. These projections are the baseline scenarios.
- Third, the quantification of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in non-CO2 emissions and in non-energy sectors:Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.

We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fourth, the quantification of the AIM Act, which was not part of the policies considered in the baseline scenario taken from Global Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections & Mitigation Potential:Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target.

- Fifth, economy wide emission projections from a 2024 study by the Rhodium Group (King, Kolus, et al., 2024) were included in the analysis as well, after deducting LULUCF sinks based on the 5th BUR. The study includes additional policies, including the impact of the EPA's emissions standards for vehicles beginning in model year 2027 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i) and the EPA's pollution standards for fossil fuel power plants (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m). This study represents the lower end of the current policy projections range.

# Targets


## Target overview

In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the US has set a target to reduce emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (U.S. Government, 2021). This target covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (GHGs). The CAT assessment excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target, resulting in a 45%–50% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. The CAT rates the US domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution.

The US submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, officially committing to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).


## NDC Updates

The US submitted its current, more ambitious NDC target on 22 April 2021. President Biden moved to re-join the Paris Agreement on his first day in office in 2021. In line with its re-joining the agreement, the US submitted a strengthened NDC, in which the government commits to reducing emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF).

The CAT estimates that the target would translate to a range of 3,790–4,131 MtCO2e absolute GHG emissions in 2030, excluding LULUCF (or 45%–50% below 2005 levels), depending on whether the sink from LULUCF is at the high or low end of the projections (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

The current NDC target represents major progress beyond the Obama-era target of 26%–28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Nevertheless, the NDC is not ambitious enough to bring US domestic emissions in line with what would be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.

CAT analysis indicates that the US should aim to reduce its national emissions by at least 58% below 2005 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF) and provide support to other countries in order to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Doing so will also put the US on track to achieve the Biden Administration’s 2050 net zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b). The US has not submitted an update to its NDC since 2021, even though the Glasgow Climate Pact mandates countries revisit and strengthen their NDCs.

* The ‘Critically insufficient’ rating was based on the fact that the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and was not an assessment of the NDC emissions level, which itself would fall in the ‘Insufficient range’ based on the CAT’s prior rating system (which was updated in September 2021).

- 23.04.2021 “Ambitious US target upgrade reduces the 2030 global emissions gap by 5–10%”
- 12.12.2019 “The U.S. expected to rejoin the Paris Agreement in early 2021, bringing back the US leadership in climate action”
- 04.11.2019 “The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement”

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what would qualify as a country’s fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The US does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excluding emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry or LULUFC) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.**

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Although the target represents a significant improvement compared to its first NDC, the current target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvements.

NDC target against fair share

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that US’ NDC target for 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The US target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. The target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow US’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The US’ international climate finance contributions is rated “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve the US’ fair share rating.

We rate the US’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically insufficient.” The US has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been much lower than its fair share. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuel financing abroad (and not only coal).

The US Congress approved a budget allocation for international climate finance of no less than USD 0.9bn (Congressional Research Service, 2024) for FY2024, although the Biden Administration requested an allocation of USD 5bn. As a result of a more stringent federal spending cap, the FY2024 finance provision is less than the provision in the first years of the Biden Administration (Thwaites, 2024). For FY2025, the administration accordingly reduced its requested funding to USD 3.5bn.

The US State Department, however, claims it is on track to reach its pledge to contribute USD 11.4bn per year by 2024, with a projected contribution of USD 9.5bn in FY2023 (U.S. Department of State, 2024). The difference between the climate finance commitment approved by Congress and the total claimed by the State Department is due to the fact that Congress’ funding only represents a small share of US’ total international climate finance, as other agencies contribute the bulk of financing (Thwaites, 2024; U.S. Department of State, 2024). However, the sources of the US’ climate finance are not transparently reported.

While Congress’ budget allocation does not include any funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the US government has pledged to contribute USD 3bn to the GCF. The GCF is the primary international vehicle for supporting developing countries in their efforts to respond to and build resilience to the climate crisis (DeLauro, 2022).

The commitment of USD 11.4bn per year by 2024 falls short of the US’ fair contribution. While the OECD reported in 2022 that international climate finance provided by developed countries exceeded the USD 100bn goal per year for the first time, a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” for post-2025 is already being discussed by UNFCCC parties (UNFCCC, 2024).

To demonstrate global leadership on climate finance and to contribute towards its fair share, the US needs to substantially scale up its international climate finance provisions. The CAT finance rating would improve if the US were to successfully augment its level of finance through a sustained upwards trend in annual contributions.

The US has historically provided a significant portion of its climate-related financial contributions as grants, which are more concessional than loans. Climate finance contributions declined during the Trump Administration, but this trend has since been reversed by the Biden Administration, which in 2021 increased its bilateral climate-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) (OECD, 2022).

Bilateral climate finance by the US, as reported as principal and significant financing, further increased in 2022 as a result of an increase in adaptation financing. Principal mitigation financing actually decreased by half, from almost USD 1bn to less than USD 500m, reflecting a shift by the Biden Administration towards adaptation financing (OECD, 2024). Overall, the US' allocation of funding to bilateral climate-related ODA increased from 3% in 2021 to 10% in 2022 of total ODA spending, but remains well below the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries' average of 24% (Donor Tracker, 2021, 2023). This continues to highlight a substantial shortage in the US' financial commitment to addressing climate change through ODA. Increasing these contributions would not only allow the US to play a larger role in global climate action, but would also align with its renewed commitment to international cooperation under the Biden Administration.

The US, along with several other countries, agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” by the end of 2022 (The White House, 2021a). The 2023 G7 Communique claims to have achieved this goal (The White House, 2023d). However, the US has neither developed plans nor introduced policies to implement this commitment. The US also has not supported a proposal put forward by the European Union to end fossil fuel finance from export banks (E&E News by POLITICO, 2024).

In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the US (EXIM), an independent US government agency that provides concessions for projects that seek to boost US exports, continued to lend money to foreign fossil fuel projects, including USD 100m to Indonesia’s national oil company to expand an oil refinery and boost production. Estimates suggest that EXIM’s total lending amounted to USD 1bn in 2023 (Aronoff, 2023).

While the US government claims to be actively working with EXIM to end its financing of fossil fuel projects, the export agency itself does not seem to take a proactive role in doing so, claiming it has no jurisdiction to end these projects (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). In January 2024, EXIM’s lack of action resulted in two members of the agency’s climate advisory board resigning over a decision to support a fossil fuel project in Bahrain (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024). EXIM plans to finance further fossil fuel projects, including in Guyana, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea (Friends of the Earth US, 2024).

Although the US has not approved any new domestic coal projects in more than a decade (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024), the US continues to support existing coal projects abroad, such as the Jawa 9-10 Suralaya Coal Plant in Indonesia and the Long Phu 1 Coal Plant in Vietnam (EndCoal, 2020). The US should stop supporting all fossil fuel developments abroad to improve its climate finance rating.


## Net zero target

The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, in which the US officially commits to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning (U.S. Department of State, 2021).

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping in its target coverage. It could also explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without the use of international offsets.

The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The US government should further explain how its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

**For the full analysis of the net zero target, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

The effects of COVID-19 induced a temporary drop in emissions that helped the US meet its 2020 targets under the Copenhagen Accord. Total emissions in 2020 decreased by 22% below 2005 as a result of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. The US 2020 target was to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 (U.S. Department of State, 2010). Despite reaching the 2020 target, GHG emissions bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.


# Summary


## Overview

**Under the Biden Administration, the US has seen promising signs of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is mobilising historic levels of investment in clean energy solutions and activating subnational and non-state action on climate change. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recently revised regulations in the power and transport sectors further enhance the government’s climate policy package.**

**Although the country has made progress under the Biden Administration, the US will still be far from meeting its domestic climate target—let alone aligning its emissions with a 1.5°C trajectory—without additional, drastic emissions reductions measures. To meet its domestic target, the US would need to bolster its policy packages at the sectoral level to address the rising demand for electricity across sectors.**

**The government would also need to reverse the trend of increasing fossil fuel extraction.** **CAT analysis**** in 2022 shows the US is also moving in the wrong direction regarding its international support for fossil fuels. Overall, the CAT rates the US climate targets, action, and climate finance at the end of the Biden Administration as “Insufficient”. An assessment of the impact of the Trump Administration will follow once information is available.**

On 5 November 2024, former President Donald Trump won the US election, and will take office on 20 January 2025. The US will continue to face the challenges in meeting its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and achieving future climate goals aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. Reaching these targets will require the implementation of additional policies, which may prove challenging under the Trump Administration. However, opportunities remain for climate action at the state and municipality level and for furthering the progress made under the IRA.

As of 2022, the US has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target. CAT current policies projections, which include the IRA, show a more pronounced reduction in emissions until 2030 compared to historic reductions. Although CAT projections suggest the US will close the gap by an additional 30%–44% by 2030, it is still 23%–37% short of meeting its 2030 emissions reduction target; evidence that further action is critically necessary. The current US target of 50–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 is not 1.5˚C compatible.

**Although there have been positive developments under the IRA, oil and gas production** **has increased under the Biden Administration.** The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record-level production in 2023. The country is also the worlds' largest fossil gas producer and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter for liquified natural gas (LNG). In 2022, fossil fuels also received the largest subsidies from the government since 2010. In early 2024, the Biden Administration placed a temporary moratorium on pending LNG export terminals. However, the administration continues to approve large-scale fossil fuel projects.

**The IRA has had its most positive impact on the power sector**. The government’s decarbonisation target for the power sector aligns with the CAT’s Paris Agreement-compatible benchmarks, as well as with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero strategy: by 2035, the US aims to achieve net zero emissions in the sector. The IRA has stimulated large investment in technologies critical for decarbonising the power sector, but barriers remain; especially since the demand for electricity is expected to grow significantly. Important areas for the power sector's transition, such as the electricity grid, have been significantly underfunded. The anticipated coal phase-out, as out outlined in the recently revised EPA standards, will be too late to be Paris Agreement compatible, and fossil gas-fired plants are largely exempt from the standards.

**In the transport sector, the IRA has particularly supported the manufacturing and uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), while the EPA has enhanced the regulatory framework for EVs by revising its emissions standards until 2032.** The government aims to decarbonise the sector by 2050. However, this timeline is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The IRA has spurred significant investment in the domestic EV value chain, especially in battery manufacturing, and the deployment of HDVs in commercial and public fleets. The act also expands subsidies for EV purchases and unlocks new funding for public transport.

**A major ambition gap continues to exist in the industry sector, where the government has set a decarbonisation objective but has not specified a clear timeline for reaching the objective.** The IRA provides a patchwork of instruments to support technologies to decarbonise the industry sector. The IRA unlocks billions in funding for industrial technologies in their research and development phase, while introducing and expanding tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage deployment, renewable energy and critical material projects, and clean hydrogen production. The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (AIM) continues to phase down F-gases significantly.

**The government’s emissions reductions targets for the buildings sector are not aligned with the Paris Agreement.** Due to limited federal measures to regulate building energy use and emissions, the decarbonisation of the sector will likely heavily rely on electrification. Without further efforts to reduce building envelope energy use and emissions, this dependency will put increasing pressure on the power sector and its decarbonisation.

**The agriculture sector lacks a clear decarbonisation objective and, while the IRA allocates funding to boost conservation programmes, the act’s measures do not seem to meaningfully reduce sectoral emissions and even include funding for livestock production.** The US has neither developed or implemented any regulations to address emissions from animal production, nor has it meaningfully encouraged dietary change. Such demand-side changes could result in large mitigation impacts in the US, which has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world.

**Net forest sinks are threatened by land conversion, increasing demand for timber products, and more frequent natural disturbances from climate change.** The IRA increased funding for the National Forest Service and other programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities, but logging efforts are nevertheless set to increase.

**Aside from strengthening its sectoral policies and targets and reducing fossil fuel exploitation and exportation, the US should address gaps in its international climate contributions:**

- **Increase international climate finance contributions and cease funding fossil fuels abroad.** The Biden Administration is still far from reaching its pledge of USD 11.4bn/year. In FY2023, only USD 1bn was appropriated for climate finance by the US Congress. The US also broke its commitment to stop financing fossil fuels abroad when the American Export-Import Bank (EXIM) lent USD 100m to Indonesia to expand an oil refinery in May 2023.
- **Increase the ambition of its NDC.** The US has not yet updated its climate target despite the commitment to do so by countries at COP26 in 2021. For the US climate target to be compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory, the country must reduce its emissions by at least 62%–65% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF), while providing more financial support to other countries.

## Description of CAT ratings

The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which, in absence of a better method, are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.

Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.

The CAT rates the combination of the US 2030 climate targets, policies, and climate finance as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the totality of the government’s policies and proposals need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.

The US 2030 domestic emissions reduction target (NDC) is consistent with 2°C of warming when compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways, but not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. US policies and action lead to falling emissions in 2030, but not by enough to meet either its targets or the 1.5°C limit.

The US does not meet its fair-share contributions to climate change and, in addition to strengthening its domestic targets and policies, needs to provide and mobilise further support to developing countries.

The US will need to implement additional policies to reach its mitigation targets. The CAT projects US GHG emissions in 2030 to be 29%–39% below 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), falling short of its 2030 NDC target (44%–49% excl. LULUCF), and significantly short of its fair share target.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. Although the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry, it is the most ambitious climate policy package in US history and brings the country closer to meeting its 2030 target.

Although the IRA is a major step towards achieving the US NDC, the government still needs to introduce additional policies and action to achieve its domestic emissions reduction target. EPA standards in the power and transport sector passed in 2024 are important complementary instruments. However, more ambitious (sectoral) climate policies at the federal and state levels are still needed to reach the US targets. The increasing trend in oil and gas production also needs to be reversed.

The projected emissions trajectory range in this update is wider than in the previous update, due to the inclusion of a broader set of models to estimate the IRA's impact. The range of policy projections for the US falls into the “Insufficient” category but reaches the “Almost sufficient” category at its lower end.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the government’s climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvement to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

**See full summary of** **policies and actions here****.**

We rate the US domestic target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.** The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US domestic target for 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.

We rate the US target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 44%–49% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The CAT’s assessment of the US’ total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the 2030 target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Some of these improvements should be made to the domestic emissions target itself, others could come in the form of further financial support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.

We rate the United States’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on the government’s 2022 OECD contributions. The Biden Administration committed to increase its climate finance contributions but contributions until 2024 remain low compared to its fair share. In FY2024, only USD 1bn (approximately the same amount as in 2023) were appropriated for climate finance by Congress.

While the government claims larger sums have been made available (notably, USD 5.8 bn in 2022), these funds mainly relate to adaptation and/or are not principal financing. Only principal mitigation financing is accounted for in the CAT's rating. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and stop supporting fossil fuels abroad.

The US’ climate finance is not sufficient to improve the rating of its NDC against its fair share, and the CAT rates the US’s overall fair share contribution as “Insufficient”.

We evaluate the US net zero target as: **Average.** The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), in which the US officially commits to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 latest.

The net zero target covers all GHG emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature- and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target, such as including international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly committing to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets.


# Net zero targets


## Summary

We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.**

The Biden Administration submitted the US long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021), officially committing the US to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by land-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning.

The government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture and transparency of its net zero target. The government could include international aviation and shipping to its target coverage, and explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without any use of international offsets. The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The government further ought to explain how and why its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

The foreseen use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the government’s plan is concerning given that CCS is not commercially viable due to its high additional costs and does not reduce the emissions to zero (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a). Modelling exercises examining a net zero power sector by 2035 highlight that under a variety of scenarios considering different technology options, fossil CCS plays a diminishing or no role at all (Denholm et al., 2022). While the strategy acknowledges the uncertainties around carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, further emissions reductions efforts should be undertaken to reduce the significant amount of CDR required in the strategy: CDR should only be treated as a last-resort option.

## Ten key elements

- **Target year** – The US government is committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Emissions coverage** – The US net zero target includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **International aviation and shipping** – The US government deliberately excludes international aviation and shipping from its net zero target’s coverage (U.S. Department of State, 2021).
- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The US government reserves its right to use international market mechanisms towards the achievement of this net zero goal (U.S. Department of State, 2021), even if it currently does not expect to do so.
- **Legal status** – The US government submitted its updated long-term strategy (LTS) including its net zero announcement to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The net zero target has not yet been enshrined in law as of November 2024.
- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The US government does not provide separate emissions reductions and removal targets. However, the US provides projections on its use of direct air capture (DAC) and LULUCF in its LTS.
- **Review process** – The LTS specifies that progress toward the net zero target will be regularly assessed without providing further specific information on the envisioned process. The government has indicated that it may update the LTS in the future, but has not committed to any legally-binding revision process.
- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The US government provides transparent assumptions and pathways on both natural sinks and technology-based CDR towards 2050 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Land‑based sinks reach roughly 600–1,400 MtCO2e in 2050, while technology-based CDR reaches roughly 300–500 MtCO2e in 2050. On the latter, no detailed information is provided on storage capacities for captured carbon emissions, nor the combination of technologies envisioned to increase this sink. As the CAT’s net zero evaluations across all countries highlight, this represents a higher reliance on CDR compared to the average of the other G20 countries that are member of the Climate Neutrality Coalition: on average G20 countries have 5% residual emissions in the target year whereas the US include 8%-23% residual emissions in 2050 as a share of 2019 emissions.
- **Comprehensive planning** – The updated LTS presents multiple pathways and a set of transparent assumptions to reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021). The government has outlined multiple measures and actions across different sectors, most prominently to fully decarbonise domestic electricity supply by 2035 (assuming a substantial increase of electricity generation capacity using fossil fuels equipped with CCS in 2050).Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets. However, the US, already the largest oil and gas producer in the world, also continues to increase its oil and gas extraction activities, and continues to approve large-scale oil and gas projects. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. This stands in stark contrast to the IEA’s NZE Scenario which clearly states that “no new long-lead time upstream oil and gas projects are needed” (IEA, 2023b). The government also announced that it would publish a ‘U.S. National Climate Strategy (NCS)’ alongside its LTS, which was meant to quantify the immediate, concrete policies and action needed to put the US on track to meet its 2030 NDC target. Three years later, however, this strategy has still not been made public.The US government claims that the NDC target is fully aligned with pathways reaching net zero target. CAT estimates that to achieve the net zero target, total GHG emissions must continue decreasing by 5%-10% annually from NDC levels in 2030 until 2050, excl. LULUCF. The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- Other intermediate targets in the transport sector, for example, are to (1) increase the share of new zero-emissions light-duty cars sold in 2030 to 50% of total sales and to (2) produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. The Inflation Reduction Act includes considerable provisions to advance and deploy renewable energy technologies, accelerate light-duty vehicle electrification, and promote sustainable aviation fuel production, amongst other measures to meet such outlined targets.

The minimum bound of the range (i.e., 5% annual reduction) is consistent with the emissions reductions needed from today’s levels to meet the upper end of the NDC target by 2030.
- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The US government makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.

## Good practice

The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.


# 2035 NDC


## 2035 NDC Target Overview

The Trump Administration’s move to exit the Paris Agreement will effectively annul the 2035 climate target submitted by the Biden Administration in late 2024. More importantly and more materially, the Trump Administration’s actions to dismantle policies and rescind funding for climate change mitigation means that limiting peak global warming to 1.5°C will be even more challenging and will require other countries to make more rapid and even deeper emissions reductions. The Trump Administration’s climate agenda is seriously risking a high, multi-decadal overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s long-term 1.5°C temperature limit, even if a future US administration strengthens its targets and actions.

The 2035 NDC submitted by the Biden Administration can still act as a guide for subnational and non-state entities to continue climate action in the US, even as the Trump Administration has initiated the process to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. However, it should be noted that the Biden era 2035 climate target is not 1.5˚C aligned. Therefore, subnational actors seeking to advance Paris-aligned action must go beyond this target and its measures.

The Biden Administration's NDC sets a 2035 target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 61–66% below 2005 levels. The target covers all sectors and all gases. The CAT, which excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), finds that the target results in 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035. This target is not 1.5°C-compatible against modelled domestic pathways: a 1.5°C compatible emissions level, excluding LULUCF, would be 2,200 MtCO2e in 2035.

At the time the Biden Administration submitted the NDC, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) were the central federal mechanisms for driving emission reductions towards the 2035 target. However, under the CAT's current policy projections—which consider the impact of the BIL and IRA and were developed before the Trump Administration took office—the US will not reduce emissions fast enough to reach the 2035 target.

To reach the Biden Administration’s target, the US government would have needed to implement new, additional climate policies and actions; an outlook that the Trump Administration has rendered unlikely, as it has already taken executive actions to repeal existing climate policies, including the BIL and IRA, limit federal funding for climate action, and expand fossil fuel production.

The Biden Administration worked in close collaboration and cooperation with subnational actors in state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments to develop the 2035 target. If the Trump Administration continues to obstruct and undo climate policies, subnational and non-state actors need to slow the impact of the federal rollback of climate policies by strengthening climate action at the subnational level.


## Ambition

For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. The US’ submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.

The submitted NDC of 2,900–3,400 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it is above the 1.5°C compatible threshold. To be 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways, the US would need to reduce its emissions, excluding LULUCF, to 2,225 MtCO2e in 2035. The 2035 NDC does not increase the 2030 NDC target’s ambition.

The US 2035 economy-wide target does not include specific sectoral plans and targets. The NDC does outline the key federal policies in the power, buildings, transport, industry, agriculture, and forestry sectors that were expected to drive emissions reductions towards the 2035 target. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)—both of which were developed by the Biden Administration and were introduced after the US 2030 NDC submission—are described as the principal national-level policies for achieving the 2035 target. The BIL aims to expedite the development and implementation of clean energy infrastructure. The IRA is intended to mobilise unprecedented public and private investment in clean energy production. In combination, the BIL and IRA were planned to incentivise and accelerate climate action across the US economy and, since their introduction, have already reduced emissions.

It is important to note that the future of both the BIL and IRA is uncertain. The Trump Administration has already taken executive action to freeze federal funding under both laws, and has signalled that it will try to roll back certain components. While the Trump Administration cannot use executive action to unilaterally repeal either the BIL or IRA, Republican majorities in the House and in Congress may be supportive of and carry out the administration’s agenda. As of October 2024, Republicans voted 53 times in the House and once in the Senate to repeal certain climate provisions in the IRA since its introduction in 2022.

The NDC explicitly draws attention to the US federal governance structure and highlights the importance and capacity of state and other subnational governments to contribute towards the 2035 target. State governments are especially well-positioned to reduce emissions in the power, transport, and buildings sectors. However, if the Trump Administration, with support from the Republican majority in both the House and Congress, permanently restricts funding or reverses regulations for the BIL and IRA’s implementation, it is unclear whether subnational entities would be able to make up the lack of federal funding and policies.

The 2035 NDC does not include a renewable energy capacity target. Instead, the document references the US power sector target of generating 100% “clean,” “carbon pollution-free" electricity by 2035. This target is not—and should not be—conflated with a renewable energy target. The target’s formulation allows the government to use fossil energy with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), as well as nuclear and biomass energy, to achieve the target. The NDC cites the current share of renewable energy generation, which has more than doubled over the past decade; in 2023, renewables generated 21% of the US electricity.

The NDC claims the 2035 target is fully aligned with its net zero pathway; it argues that “the entire 2035 range is on a straight line or steeper trajectory to net zero emissions by 2050 for all greenhouse gases.” To achieve its net zero target, the CAT estimates the US needs to reduce emissions to 558–1,540 MtCO2e or 80-93% below 2005 levels in 2050, excluding LULUCF. Assuming the US realises its 2030 NDC target, the 2035 NDC target is aligned with the median net zero pathway, but not the pathway’s uppermost bound. Further information on the US net zero target can be found here.

The NDC explicitly refers to the outcomes of the first Global Stocktake. The NDC outlines targets, measures, and metrics that correspond with some of the Global Stocktake’s sectoral goals. Highlights include references to the US expansion of renewable energy generation, the rate of electrification and energy efficiency improvements, the adoption of zero- and low-emissions vehicles, and the commitment to halting and reversing deforestation by 2030. It is important to note that the US does not commit to phasing out either fossil gas or coal.


## Fairness & Finance

Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries.

In its 2035 NDC, the US does not acknowledge its responsibility, nor communicate its intention to provide and mobilise climate finance to other countries. The US did not do so in its 2030 NDC either. Developed countries, like the US, are expected to complement their domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries.

Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. The US submitted 2035 NDC is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.


## Credibility

Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reductions target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the still significant emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.

The US 2035 NDC details the planning processes behind the target’s development and the existing measures for its implementation. However, the CAT finds that the US would need to go beyond the Biden Administration’s policies and actions and enact new measures to reach the 2035 target. The Trump Administration has vowed to reverse the Biden Administration's course on climate action and has already taken executive action to undermine many of the policies that underpin the NDC. The administration’s initiation of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement essentially voids the NDC, and the administration's actions entirely compromise the target’s credibility.

The US needs to implement new, additional climate policies and actions to reach its 2035 target, as current policies are insufficient. The CAT estimates that existing policies will reduce emissions by 33–50% below 2005 levels in 2035, emitting 3,780–5,071 MtCO2e in 2035, well below a 1.5˚C compatible level of 2,225 MtCO2e.

The 2035 NDC’s development was coordinated and managed by the Biden Administration’s White House Climate Policy Office. Central to the target’s development was a bottom-up analysis of existing and possible policies at the national, subnational, and non-state level.

The revision was drafted in consultation and cooperation with a broad, diverse coalition of state, territorial, Tribal, and local governments, as well as workers unions, private sector representatives, civil society organisations, and higher education institutions. In doing so, the NDC acknowledges the important role of subnational and non-state climate action.

While the NDC highlights the importance of subnational and non-state climate action, it also identifies national-level policies that are key to the realisation of the 2035 target. The BIL and IRA are described as “the backbone of the suite of existing federal legislation and investments that are contributing to the achievement the 2035 NDC target.” However, the future of these policies is uncertain. The Trump Administration has signalled that it will try to eliminate components of the BIL and IRA and has also initiated processes to reverse emissions standards in the power and transport sectors; the standards that were strengthened under the Biden Administration and are cited in the NDC as important components for realising the 2035 target.

In its NDC, the US does not commit to discontinuing fossil fuel exploration, production, or subsidies. The US is the world’s largest producer of crude oil and fossil gas. Since 2022, the US is the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG). The US government continues to heavily subsidise fossil fuels: in 2023, fossil fuel subsidies totalled nearly USD 15bn. The US plans to expand oil and gas production and increase LNG exports. The US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) most recent projections of the US energy market forecast that fossil gas production will increase by 15% and LNG exports will increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest emitters in the world, the US has a responsibility to take ambitious action to phase out fossil fuels.


## Transparency

Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emissions reductions target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) to ensure they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.

The US 2035 NDC target is not based on an absolute value. Instead, the target is formulated as a percentage reduction below 2005 levels.

The NDC target covers all sectors, including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). The NDC does not break down the economy-wide target by sector. As a result, it is unclear how each sector would contribute to meeting the target. The inclusion of the LULUCF sector’s emissions, which are uniquely challenging to account for, undermines the target’s transparency.

The target considers all greenhouse gas emissions, but does not set targets for specific greenhouse gases. However, the NDC anticipates a reduction of methane emissions of at least 35% below 2005 levels in 2035. The NDC also forecasts “significant emissions reductions from other non-carbon dioxide super pollutants.”

The 2035 NDC does not define a specific emissions pathway, claiming “the NDC is built on the premise that there are multiple pathways to achieving the expected level of emissions reductions.” The NDC does not provide any further clarification on the number of and differences between pathways.

In the NDC, the US does not transparently communicate the intended or expected contribution of the carbon dioxide removals (CDR) or carbon markets. The NDC leaves the door open for the use of contentious voluntary carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; the NDC notes, in the case that the US relies on carbon markets to achieve its target, the government would appropriately report the use of such market mechanisms.

# Policies & action

According to our analysis, the US will need to implement additional policies to reach its targets. We project GHG emissions will reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e in 2030 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF). This is equivalent to 29%–39% reduction from 2005 levels (excl. LULUCF), which is insufficient to meet the NDC target (45%–50% excl. LULUCF).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, represents a significant milestone in US climate policy. While its full impact is still unfolding due to the nature of its 10-year implementation plan, the first years have shown real promise. The IRA is mobilising historic investments in clean energy, driving clean projects, creating jobs, and attracting private sector funding. EPA standards for the power and transport sectors, passed in 2024, provide two further milestones in important policy areas.

However, to achieve its domestic emissions reductions target—let alone to reach a 1.5°C-compatible emissions level—the government needs to complement its recent advancements with further sector-specific policies and a shift away from fossil fuels.

The projected emissions trajectory range is wider in this update than previously, due to the incorporation of new analyses that better highlight the uncertainties related to the IRA's implementation. While the middle of the policy projections' range falls into the “Insufficient” category, its lower end, representing a positive outlook on the government’s current policies, falls into the “Almost sufficient” range.

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that the US’ climate policies and action in 2030 need substantial improvements to be consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C. The Biden Administration has set the goal to decarbonise the power sector by 2035, which is consistent with a Paris Agreement pathway.

**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**


## Policy overview

According to our analysis, the US will need to implement additional policies to reach its 2030 and long-term targets. After an increase in GHG emissions between 2021 and 2022, US emissions started to decline in 2023 (-1.9%) (Rhodium Group, 2024). The government has set a target to reduce emissions by 3.8–4.2 GtCO2e/year in 2030.

According to our projections, emissions are forecasted to decline at an average of 1.7%–3.9% per year and reach between 4.6–5.4 GtCO2e/year by 2030 (29%–39% below 2005 levels; and 19%–31% below 1990), excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Under these projections, the US would achieve 64%–87% of its emissions reduction target in 2030, indicating a gap of 13%–36% that would need to be filled with new and additional climate policies and action. As it stands, the 2030 target is not 1.5˚C compatible. To reach a level in line with a global least-cost pathway requires further reductions of 1.4–2.2 GtCO2e below the current policy pathway.

Compared to CAT projections in August 2023, our range of emission projections includes an updated estimate of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) impact, as well as estimates of the impact of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2024 regulations for the power and transport sectors. As a result, the US emissions projections decreased relative to the CAT’s previous projections, while the range, based on existing policies, widened for 2030–2035. The upper bound decreased by 2% and the lower bound decreased by 8%. The reduced, widened range in emission projections highlights the continued effort by the US government to cut emissions, while recognising the high uncertainty of policy outcomes; especially for the government’s flagship climate policies, including the IRA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

The IRA injects USD 370bn into the US economy over a 10-year period. This takes the form of tax credits, grants, and loans intended to develop and deploy the clean energy technologies and investments that are essential to the economy's decarbonisation (The White House, 2023a).

Since the IRA's implementation in 2022, the country has witnessed a significant surge in public and private investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure: between August 2022 and February 2024, investment in announced clean energy projects and infrastructure totalled USD 352bn. Specific highlights include record investment in battery and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and in grid and transmission infrastructure (Climate Power, 2024c).

Due to these investments, the share of clean energy investments in total investments increased from 3.7% in Q4 of 2022 to 5% in Q4 in 2023, representing a significant uptick in the role that clean energy investments play in the US economy (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). Given the scale of public investment, some studies suggest that the IRA could spur USD 3tn in private investments over the coming decade (Goldman Sachs, 2023).

The BIL and IRA, alongside the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, have set the stage for record private investment in the construction of domestic manufacturing facilities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023b).

Before the IRA and CHIPS Act were signed, annual investment in manufacturing construction remained below USD 150bn. Since the acts’ passage, investment surged to an all-time high of USD 223bn by February 2024 (FRED Economic data, 2024; Joint Economic Committee, 2024).

Investment in the EV supply chain, especially in battery cell manufacturing and critical mineral production, has increased significantly and accounts for nearly two-thirds of all clean manufacturing investments by the of 2023 (Rhodium Group; MIT CEEPR;, 2024). As a result of this increase in investment, the US surpassed the EU in battery cell manufacturing capacity in 2023, even though the EU’s capacity was two times larger than the US’ capacity in 2021 (Delgado et al., 2024).

These investments contribute to job creation, with estimates showing the IRA’s provisions have already generated over 270,000 clean energy jobs (Climate Power, 2024b). The act has also contributed to a more just energy transition by targeting disadvantaged communities and rural areas. Many of the announced investments specifically target - and aim to contribute to - the economic development of these regions and communities (U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023a).

In early 2024, the US expanded its climate policy portfolio through the addition of several EPA policies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024h, 2024l). The EPA introduced several standards for gas and coal-fired power plants as well as updated vehicle emissions standards. Even though these standards were watered down before their finalisation (see Electricity generation and Transport sections below), they add an important regulatory complement to the incentive-based IRA: by setting yearly emissions levels for technologies, the standards provide important guidance for the private sector.

To realise its 2030 and 2035 targets and to align with the Paris Agreement’s (PA) 1.5˚C temperature goal, the US has to implement further, more ambitious policies and measures. Additional measures could focus on those sectors in which ambitious action has yet to be taken, such as the building or agriculture sector.

At the same time, the government can further strengthen existing policies across all sectors; for example, the government could extend the IRA beyond 2030, introduce coal phase-out targets for 2030, and enhance energy efficiency standards (America Is All In, 2024). Manufacturing capacity could also be strengthened, in particular for wind and heat pump production (IEA, 2024a). Given that the federal government’s jurisdiction is limited some policy areas, state governments can play a significant role.

Some states, such as Massachusetts, Michigan, and Minnesota, have recently introduced climate policies that are more ambitious than at the federal level (Joselow & Montalbano, 2023). To advance climate action at the subnational level, state governments can adopt of renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and introduce sales targets for EVs (America Is All In, 2024; IEA, 2024a).

Despite the IRA’s remarkable measures to support clean energy and address climate change, the IRA includes several concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The concessions are described in the Power section.


## Power

Electricity supply contributed to 25% of total US GHG emissions in 2022 (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). Total annual emissions in the power sector have declined steadily since 2010, mainly driven by a shift from coal to lower or non-emitting sources of generation, such as fossil gas and renewables.

Electricity production from renewables overtook production from coal and nuclear power for the first time in 2022, making renewables the country’s second largest source of electricity generation after fossil gas (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j). Coal has now becoming the least relevant generation source in the US (excluding oil), if all forms of renewables are counted together. Following a drop in CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions in the power sector returned to pre-pandemic levels as the economy recovered but began dropping again in 2023. In 2021, electricity generation and emissions from coal-fired power plants increased for the first time since 2014 by 16% and 15%, respectively (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f).

The marked increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, and its sustained elevated level in 2022, can be mainly attributed to the significantly higher and more volatile prices of fossil gas as a consequence of the 2021 energy crisis, which rendered coal more competitive (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021b, 2023n).

In 2023, gas generation rebounded and replaced coal generation, which led to emissions reductions in the sector. Although renewables contributed to sectoral emissions reductions, fossil gas had more than double the growth rate of renewable generation.

The Biden Administration announced a target for a carbon-free electricity system by 2035. The CAT estimates that the full decarbonisation of the US power sector by 2035 would reduce total economy-wide emissions by about 25% below 2005 levels by 2030. The goal of a carbon-free power supply by 2035 is aligned with the Paris Agreement (PA), based on the CAT’s primary global least-cost based benchmarks (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b), as well as with the IEA’s suggested net zero target year for advanced economies (IEA, 2021). If accompanied by ambitious electrification targets in other sectors, such as 100% EV sales by 2030 or the full electrification of building heating, the US would be on track to meet the target of 50%–52% emissions reductions below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b).

It is important to note that since setting the 2035 target, the US government reframed its position on phasing out fossil fuels: the US now aims to achieve “a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035" instead of a “carbon pollution free” sector. Such reformulation enables the use of abated fossil fuel generation (e.g. with carbon capture and storage), as well as the use of fossil fuels in sectors that are not directly related to electricity generation (GEM Wiki, 2024).

However, emissions in the power sector must reduce more rapidly to reach the US economy-wide target. In 2021, total emissions from electricity generation had decreased by 36% compared to 2005 levels. With the introduction of the IRA, emissions from electricity generation are projected to further decrease by 67%–87% compared to 2005 levels by 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b). More recent analysis, which takes into account the recent EPA regulations in the power sector, suggests that emissions might be even further reduced to 90% below 2005 levels by 2035 (King, Kolus, et al., 2024).

Nevertheless, a gap remains between the projections and target, highlighting the need for additional, more ambitious policies and actions.

The US is making **“Slow Progress”** on deploying renewables. The share of renewables in US electricity generation gradually increased over the last five years and accounted for approximately 24% of total US electricity generation in 2024 (Ember, 2025). Increasingly cost-competitive renewables, in combination with the IRA and state-level renewable portfolio standards (RPS), are driving this growth. Although moving in the right direction, the deployment of renewables needs significant acceleration over the next three decades to be compatible with 1.5°C. To align with 1.5°C, the share of renewables needs to increase to 68% by 2030, to 92% by 2040, and to 95% by 2050.

Over the past five years, installed solar and wind capacities increased by an average of 28 GW per year (Ember, 2025). Nearly 75% of added generation capacity in 2022 were renewables. The installed capacity of solar increased by roughly 20 GW in 2023 and is projected to increase by 36 GW in 2024. The annual expansion of wind capacity lags behind solar; wind capacity grew by only 6 GW in 2023 and is forecasted to increase by 7 GW in 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024d).

Modelling of the IRA’s impact on renewables suggests an average capacity deployment of 54 GW/year for renewables, driven mainly by the expansion of wind and solar (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

However, according to scenarios that model a 100% clean energy power sector by 2035, annual additions in renewable energy capacity need to increase significantly more. To achieve 100% renewable energy generation by 2035, the installed capacity of wind would need to grow by 70–145 GW/year between 2025 and 2035. During the same period, the installed capacity of solar would need to increase by 43–90 GW/year (Denholm et al., 2022).

(U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024d)(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d)The clean energy project pipeline emerging as a result of the IRA shows promising growth, having reached 309 GW of announced clean energy capacity (Cleanpower, 2024). The growth in clean energy projects is also reflected in the total project capacity seeking transmission access: in total, 1,480 GW of clean electricity generation are seeking transmission access, of which solar alone accounts for 1,086 GW (WRI, 2024).

Historically only about 14% of announced capacity gets interconnected, but the number of new projects that were announced after the passage of the IRA (e.g. more than 500 GW of solar) reflect increased developer interest and may result in a higher interconnection rate. However, major challenges for the deployment of renewables persist: complex permitting processes, higher interest rates and costs, and supply chain issues will need to be overcome to ensure project implementation (WRI, 2024).

The IRA is strengthening value chains in the medium to long term in the US by incentivising domestic manufacturing (see above), but current supply chain issues remain. While issues with the solar supply chain have been improved, other decarbonisation-critical equipment, such as transformers, are subject to enduring supply chain issues, resulting in long lead times (WRI, 2024).

Hight interest rates have increased project costs, especially for renewables with high upfront costs, and have elevated prices for power purchase agreement (PPA). In turn, higher PPA prices have reduced clean energy purchases by corporates (WRI, 2024). To address risks that lead to and are associated with higher interest rates, the IRA allocates USD 3.6bn for clean energy loans to enable USD 40bn in loan guarantees, particularly targeting new technologies (Harper et al., 2023). Other instruments, such as contracts for difference, which the EU recommends in its market design directive to its Member States (European Commission, 2023), could help minimise risks and thus financing costs, especially for offshore wind (Beiter et al., 2024).

Expanding transmission lines is a major enabler for the deployment of renewables, especially wind and solar, and is essential for their overtaking of fossil gas as the primary source of electricity generation.

The historical pace of grid extension of about 1% per year needs to increase to 2.3% per year to reach the full reduction potential of the IRA; a net zero pathway would require an even faster expansion (Jenkins et al., 2022). Currently, only 10% of the necessary investment in transmission lines are in the pipeline (WRI, 2024).

This low level of investment is especially alarming given that transmission projects in the US take an average of 10 years to build (WRI, 2023). Although state governments are primarily responsible for maintaining and upgrading grid infrastructure, federal agencies are implementing several measures to augment investment. For instance, the US Department of Energy (DOE) introduced the Coordinated Interagency Authorizations and Permits programme (CITAP), which streamlines the permitting process for transmission facilities. The DOE also unlocked additional targeted funding to expand transmission capacity (S&P Global, 2024) and is in the process of developing auxiliary measures (WRI, 2024).

Another challenge for the power sector is the growing demand for electricity. The growth in demand is not only driven by the electrification needed for a decarbonised future, but also by the emergence of large-scale data centres, the increase in manufacturing facilities, the enhanced demand for building cooling and heating, and the introduction of hydrogen fuel plants. For instance, electricity demand from data centres, which currently account for around 4% of electricity demand, is expected to grow to between 4.6% - 9.1% of electricity demand by 2030 (EPRI, 2024).

Permitting and siting are major barriers for the buildout of renewable energy capacity. Current project build times average four years. The IRA includes USD 1bn to support the May 2022 Permitting Action Plan, which seeks to accelerate the federal permitting and environmental review process for transmission lines and clean energy productions.

However, action at the state level is key because permitting and siting processes are largely controlled by subnational jurisdictions. California and Massachusetts have implemented promising approaches for streamlining the permitting process for clean energy projects that could be replicated by other states (WRI, 2023).

The federal government is also working to address issues related to project siting. The government set a target to double clean energy permits on public lands in order to reach 25 GW of renewable energy generation by 2025. This goal was reached at the end of 2023, with a total of 29 GW worth of allocated permits. A further 32 GW are currently under consideration by the government (Reuters, 2024).

The US Department of the Interior (DOI) announced a plan to deploy 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030 and unlocked USD 3bn in federal loans for offshore wind and transmission projects. By the end of FY2023, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management aims to approve a cumulative 14.8 GW in offshore wind energy capacity to support the 2030 target (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023b). However, estimates suggest that only 14.5 GW will come online by 2030, which means the government will fall significantly short of its 30 GWs goal. Approximately 11 GW of planned offshore capacity have been cancelled or are being renegotiated (Canary Media, 2023).

A diverse set of drivers have been responsible for the growth of renewable energy in the US. At the subnational level, renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and clean energy standards (CES) have been major drivers. In total, 32 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.), accounting for 58% of US electricity sales, have enacted RPS or CES legislation. Of these, 15 states and D.C. have signed 100% clean electricity goals into legislation, while seven states have enacted such a target through state-level executive orders (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023h).

While in the past, roughly half of the growth in renewable generation capacity could be associated with these legislated policies, this number was reduced in recent years, reaching only 30% by 2022. With current RPS or CES legislation alone the share of non-hydro RE will only increase to 28% by 2050, well below what is needed (see below).

Other off-taker than utilities covered by PPA such as such as voluntary utility procurements, net metered PV/onsite production or corporate PPAs have become drivers for the development of renewable energy sources. (Barbose, 2023) Given their uncertain outcome and the reduced success in recent years of high interest rates (see above), a means of ensuring the necessary capacity is built could be to extend the RPS to cover more state with increased ambition.

At the federal level, the tax credits for the production and investment in clean energy support the buildout of renewables. The Biden Administration modified and extended current Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit through 2024, at which point the credits transition towards technology-neutral, emissions-based credits in the form of the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit and the Clean Energy Investment Tax Credit.

Importantly, the current tax credit applies to all projects that commence construction by 2032, providing additional investor certainty (Harper et al., 2023). Both credits incentivise investment in disadvantaged communities and provide additional bonuses to wind and solar projects in low-income neighbourhoods (The White House, 2023c). The direct impact of these credits is uncertain and difficult to assess as they overlap, complement, and engage with other incentive schemes and market dynamics.

An EPA review of scenarios estimating the IRA’s impact, which this assessment uses for the current policy projections scenario, shows that the implementation of the IRA could lead to emission reductions of between 49%–83% in the power sector by 2030 below 2005 levels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e). The modelling projects that the share of renewables in total electricity generation will increase significantly, reaching 28%–60% in 2030 and amounting to up to 85% in 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

However, these penetration levels are insufficient to meet the Biden Administration’s 2035 goal of a carbon-free power sector. In order to be aligned with a Paris Agreement-compatible, least-cost pathway, the CAT estimates that 68%–86% of the electricity generated by 2030 should come from renewable sources (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

With an increasing share of variable renewable energy in the US electricity generation mix, there is an increasing need for supply and demand-side flexibilities. Storage needs will increase as gas-fired power plants, currently providing flexibility services, are phased out.

To decarbonise the power sector by 2035, approximately 120–350 GW of diurnal storage and up to 680 GW of seasonal storage is required in a scenario that does not include carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Harper et al., 2023). The need for utility storage and demand flexibility is also directly linked to the buildout of the transmission grid which, as highlighted above, is happening far too slowly. Building out storage capacity can reduce the need for transmission expansion and vice versa.

The IRA has spurred a significant increase in utility-scale diurnal storage projects, as evidenced by the number of storage project awaiting interconnection. Since August 2022, more than 540 GW of storage have requested interconnection, with approximately half of that storage capacity combined with a generation technology, mainly solar. In total, around 514 GW of storage is proposed to come online before the end of 2026.

Historically, only 11% of planned storage capacity has come online. However, the operationalisation rate might increase given that the IRA makes available Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits for standalone storage projects. In the current storage project pipeline, battery storage dominates. The number of other storage technologies in the pipeline, notably those better suited for seasonal storage, has also increased.

In contrast to supply flexibility, demand flexibility remains underdeveloped in the US and worldwide. Economic analyses of the US suggest that it can reduce the costs of grid extension and ancillary service costs by approximately USD 13bn/year, while simultaneously contributing to the integration of renewables (Bronski et al., 2015).

Demand flexibility can play an important role, as transmission projects are developing too slowly, and storage projects incur additional resource use. States are beginning to recognise the importance of demand flexibility: state level institutions, such as the California Utility Commission, are starting processes to enable “widespread demand flexibility” (California Public Utilities Commission, 2022). Nevertheless, demand flexibility continues to be largely underfunded.

Seasonal storage, or long-duration storage, is underdeveloped, but will likely be critical to decarbonising the power sector by 2035. Unlike for short-term, diurnal storage, where batteries have emerged as a promising, increasingly cost-competitive technology, seasonal storage is much less mature and requires significant investments in research and development. The DOE is beginning to support seasonal storage projects; it is providing a USD 504.4m loan guarantee for a hydrogen storage capacity in Utah and introduced the Long Duration Storage Shot that aims to decrease costs for seasonal storage by 90% within the coming decade (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023c). However, the government’s efforts must be intensified to deploy the technology at the scale and pace to achieve sectoral decarbonisation.

The US is headed in the “**Wrong Direction”** on fossil gas. The US has not committed to phasing out fossil gas and, over the past five years, has expanded fossil gas generation capacity (Global Energy Monitor, 2025). In 2024, fossil gas was the largest source of electricity, generating 43% of all electricity (Ember, 2025). The US needs to phase out fossil gas by 2035 in order to be 1.5°C compatible.

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets new gas-fired power plants. The EPA’s emissions standards for fossil gas distinguish between baseload and peak power plants: the standards only apply to baseload plants larger than 300MW. Plants covered by the regulation have the option to capture 90% of emitted CO2 using CCS by 2035 or transition to 96% hydrogen fuel use by 2038. These standards are projected to reduce fossil gas emissions by approximately 200–400 MtCO2e by the mid-2040s. The combined cumulative reductions for both coal and fossil gas are forecasted to amount to 600 MtCO2e by 2050. (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023j). While setting emissions limits for power plants is a step in the right direction, the regulation’s impact remains uncertain as smaller baseload plants and peak power plants are not covered.

The US is making “Slow Progress” on reducing the share of coal in its power mix. For the past five years, the share of coal in electricity generation has decreased by 1.4% per year (Ember, 2025; Global Energy Monitor, 2025). This decrease is largely driven by the continued buildout of fossil gas generation and the growth of renewable generation rather than by a federal policy push, as the US government has not set a phase-out target for coal. To be compatible with 1.5°C, the US needs to phase out coal generation by 2030.

In April 2024, the US, alongside all G7 member countries, took a positive step in the right direction by agreeing to phase out all unabated coal power generation by 2035. However, the pledge’s formulation provides flexibility for countries to reach the target. Countries do not necessarily have phase out coal by 2035 but can instead purse an alternative “timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5-degrees-Celsius temperature rise within reach, in line with countries' net zero pathways.” The pledge’s formulation also enables the use of abated coal generation using carbon capture and storage technology.

Elevated fossil gas prices induced a temporary increase in coal-fired generation in 2021, which did not last, as gas prices returned to 2020 levels in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024b). As a result, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants reduced from 48% to 42% (Inside Climate News, 2024), a trend that reflects the worsening economics of coal but also a trend that could be reversed in future if coal-fired power plants are not shut down.

Approximately 30% of the US coal-fired generating capacity has been retired since 2010: no new coal-fired capacity has been installed since 2013, and more coal power plants are due to be decommissioned in the near future (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2021a, 2023c, 2023i). However, the retirement of coal generation capacity has slowed in recent years and is expected to continue to slow in 2024. Although the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected 8.9 GW of coal-fired power plants to retire in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023c), only 5 GW actually retired (Ember, 2024). For 2024, only 2.3 GW of coal-fired power plants are set to retire, corresponding to 1.3% of total the coal fleet (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024c).

In comparison, annual coal retirements averaged 11 GW between 2015 and 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023c).The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, use as one of the reference scenarios for this assessment’s current policy projections, suggests that no new coal-fired capacity will be added in the US. In the reference case, coal-fired capacity is projected to decline by 64% to 73 GW by 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023d).

This means that a full phase-out of coal power by 2035 would require additional policy action to accelerate and reinforce market forces that, as evidenced by the last decade, are pushing coal out of the mix. According to the CAT, the US needs to phase out all coal-fired power generation by 2030 to be aligned with the Paris Agreement (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b).

In April 2024, the EPA finalised its new Greenhouse Gas Standards for Fossil-Fuel Fired Power Plants, which targets both existing coal-fired power plants and new gas-fired power plants. It includes standards for GHG emissions, waste water, mercury, and toxic metals. The standards set the most stringent emissions limits for both plant types in US history and mandate that all coal-fired power plants reduce or capture nearly all of their CO2 emissions by 2040 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i).

The regulation exempts coal-fired plants that are set to retire before 2032, while relaxing the standards for those retiring between 2032 and 2039; these plants need to reduce emissions by only 16%. Coal plants that operate beyond 2039 will be required to reduce their emissions intensity by implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to capture 90% of CO2 emissions by 2032. These requirements are expected to accelerate coal plant retirements before the 2040 deadline, resulting in an additional 22 GW of coal-fired capacity going offline between 2023 and 2035 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i).

The new regulations aim to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuel-fired power plants and explicitly allows for CCS, signalling that the government considers CCS a viable solution for emissions reductions in the mid to long term (Parenteau, 2024). However, CCS has yet to be proven commercially at scale, and it remains unclear whether the technology will have demonstrated commercial viability by 2040. Given the high cost of CCS application for fossil fuel-fired power plants (Clarke et al., 2022), our estimation is that the majority of fossil fuel-fired power plants that are subject to the proposed regulations will already cease operations by 2040.

However, if this is not the case and CCS gets deployed at scale, then the widespread adoption of CCS could lead to significant additional emissions given that current CCS technology only captures 90% of the plant’s emissions.

The EPA has encountered numerous challenges in regulating GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the past, including two failed attempts during the Obama and Trump Administrations. Most recently, in June 2022, the US Supreme Court ruled to limit the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from power plants (West Virginia v. EPA, 2022). The decision sets a worrying precedent for future climate action. However, experts suggest the design of the EPA’s most recent standards explicitly considers the weaknesses of previously proposed regulations and, therefore, gives the standards a better chance against legal challenges (Parenteau, 2024).

In parallel, the government passed stricter standards for power plants whose pollution crosses state lines (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f). The EPA has also proposed stronger limits for mercury and water pollution from coal-fired power plants. These rules do not target pollution that directly contributes to global warming, but, nevertheless, limit the operation of coal-fired power plants and, in doing so, could indirectly accelerate their phase-out (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023h, 2023i).

Unlike coal generation, oil and fossil gas generation increased significantly in 2023. More than 10GW of fossil gas-fired power plants were added in 2023, the highest increase since 2003 (Global Energy Monitor, 2024). Generation from fossil gas grew more than twice as fast as generation from renewables in 2023 (Rhodium Group, 2024).

Studies suggest that lifetime use for fossil gas-fired plants breaks even after 9–17 years of operation under current regimes. The longevity of gas-fired power plants severely hampers the phase-out of fossil gas and, as a result, either jeopardises the sector’s 2035 decarbonisation target or invites the widespread deployment of CCS if the gas-fired fleet remains in operation or is expanded (Global Energy Monitor, 2024).

The US is the world’s top oil and fossil gas producer

The US became the world’s largest producer of crude oil in 2018 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2018), reaching record levels of oil and gas production and exports in 2023. US crude oil exports hit a record 4.1 million barrels per day in 2023, corresponding to a 13% increase compared to previous record export level in 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). Increasing exports were driven by increased crude oil production, several releases from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), and increased demand in Europe for an alternative to Russian crude oil (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023k).

Exports of petroleum products similarly increased: more petroleum products were exported—nearly six million barrels per day—in the first half of 2023 than in the first half of any prior year. Since 2020, growth in propane exports has driven growth in overall petroleum product exports; approximately 1.5 million barrels were exported per day in the first half of 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023m).

The US is also the largest producer of fossil gas. Liquified natural gas (LNG) exports continue to set records year after year. In the first half of 2022, the US became the world’s largest LNG exporter. By the first half of 2023, LNG exports had further increased by 4% (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023j). This trend is expected to continue into the future as the US is planning to increase its LNG export capacity by more than 40% by 2026, compared to 2022 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023l).

The growth in exports is mainly due to strong LNG demand from Europe, as well as expanded and reopened LNG capacity. In 2022, US LNG exports to Europe increased by 141% compared to 2021 levels (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023e). Outside of Europe, interest in - and demand for - US LNG is also growing. In Mexico, new LNG terminals, as well as an expanding pipeline network, are contributing to growth in LNG imports from the US. In Asia, exports from the US continue to increase; Japan, China, and India increased imports in 2023 relative to 2022, while the Philippines and Vietnam imported LNG from the US for the first time in 2023 (Zaretskaya, 2024).

In January 2024, the Biden Administration took a step towards addressing the climate impacts of US fossil fuel exports by issuing a temporary pause on the development of new LNG export terminals (Daly, 2024). The administration cited outdated project evaluation criteria, which inadequately capture the financial and environmental cost of new LNG infrastructure, as cause for the moratorium. As of October 2024, the pause remains in place. It is important to note that the pause does not impact operational, as well as approved, LNG terminals and, as a result, does not immediately impact the US supply of LNG to Europe and Asia (The White House, 2024b).

Although a step in the right direction, the US should take stronger, more consistent action to phase out fossil fuel production and exportation. As the world’s largest fossil fuel producer and LNG exporter, as well as one of the largest GHG emitters and richest countries in the world, the US has a responsibility and is well-positioned to phase out fossil fuels.

On the international stage, the US has signalled support for a reduction in fossil fuel production: at COP26, the US pledged to end international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022 (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021b), and at COP27, the US supported language on a “fossil fuel phasedown”—but, as evidenced by ever increasing domestic oil and gas exploitation, the government has contradicted itself on this issue (CAT, 2023).

Record levels of fossil fuel production translate to record profits for oil and gas corporations. An analysis of five major fossil fuel corporations revealed that this set of companies earned USD 152bn in profit between 2017 and 2020 (Climate Power, 2024a). More recent data for 2021 through 2023 show that profits for the top ten largest oil and gas corporations by value tripled to USD 313bn under the Biden Administration in comparison to reported profits from 2017 through 2019 (McCormick & Smyth, 2024).

The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023, included in the range of our current policy scenario projections, projects US fossil gas production to increase by 15% and LNG exports to increase by 152% between 2022 and 2050 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a). This increase is due to the expected increase in domestic and foreign demand for fossil gas and a continued increase in LNG capacity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023l).

The US has one of the largest expansion plans for oil and gas projects in the world. The country accounts for over one-third of planned global expansion in oil and gas extraction between 2023 and 2050. With 22 oil and gas mega-project plans in place, the US accounts for more than one-fifth of potential emissions from major carbon emitting energy projects in the world. Together, these 22 mega-projects have the potential to emit nearly 143 GtCO2e in their lifetime, which is almost four times more than the entire world emits each year (Kühne et al., 2022).

(Climate Trace, 2023; Lu et al., 2023)Expansion of oil and gas projects is driven by planned increases in oil and gas fracking and LNG extraction (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023). In 2022, subsidies for fossil fuels, as defined as budgetary transfers, tax expenditures, and general supply- and demand-side financial support, reached their highest level since 2010: subsidies amounted to USD 14bn in 2022 (Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker, 2022).

Fossil fuel subsidies have and will continue to spur the expansion of fossil fuel projects: research indicates that two of the largest and longest standing subsidies—the ‘expensing of intangible drilling costs’ (IDC) subsidy and the ‘percentage depletion’ subsidy—increased the expected value of new oil and gas projects by upwards of USD 20bn over the past two decades (Erickson, 2021). Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which incentivises the build out of renewable energy, simultaneously enables the expansion of oil and gas production by mandating new leases on public lands for fossil fuel projects (see below on new auctions and project approvals) (Ioualalen & Trout, 2023).

(Kühne et al., 2022)(Climate Trace, 2023; Lu et al., 2023)To keep 1.5°C of warming within reach, GHG emissions must be halved globally by 2030 and no new oil and gas should be developed (IEA, 2023b; IPCC, 2022). Therefore, the planned investments in - and developments of new - oil and gas infrastructure in the US obstruct progress towards the global 1.5°C temperature target, as well as the country’s 2030 climate target and 2050 net zero target, and will likely lead to significant stranded assets in a Paris Agreement-compatible future.

New fossil fuel auctions and project approvals

Beyond the IRA’s incentives for clean energy production and investment, the act also provides notable concessions to the fossil fuel industry. The act offers these compromises under the pretence of allowing domestic oil and gas companies to transition away from fossil fuels at a reasonable pace.

The IRA requires the federal government to offer an annual minimum area of specified public lands for drilling. While the act does increase the royalty rates paid by companies for extracting fossil fuels on public lands, it also requires prioritisation of oil and gas auctions over renewable energy on federal lands and offshore developments.

These provisions not only contradict President Biden’s promise to end new federal fossil fuel leasing of public lands, but also increases the risk of locking in fossil fuel infrastructure and creating stranded assets during the energy transition. Although the Biden Administration has already reached its 2025 target for renewable energy deployment on public lands (Groom, 2024), the continued leasing of public lands for oil and gas extraction sends a long-term signal to the fossil fuel industry that may slow the pace of emissions reductions over the coming decades.

The result of new fossil fuel leasing under the IRA has been the approval of several large oil and gas projects on public lands. In March 2023, the US Department of the Interior (DOI) gave its formal approval for the ConocoPhillips Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve, which is the largest approved oil and gas project in the country (Chu, 2024). Although the DOI significantly reduced the scope of the project, the Willow Project is one of the few oil projects that the Biden Administration approved without a congressional or court mandate (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2023a).

The approval of the project breaks Biden’s promise to stop new oil drilling on federal land and will result in significant environmental and biodiversity impacts. The project has the potential to produce over 600 million barrels of crude oil over the next 30 years, which will release nearly 280 MtCO2e in emissions (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, 2023).

The Biden Administration auctioned off 73 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, more than double the size of the Willow Project, for offshore oil and gas drilling. The auction generated over USD 260m, the highest bid total since 2017. While the auctioning of these offshore sites was a mandatory provision under the IRA, the government had the ability to reduce the size and scope of the sale but chose not to (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023).

In July 2023, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline to proceed. The pipeline is a 500-km-long project that will transport fossil gas from West Virginia to Virginia. The pipeline was subject to multiple lawsuits and a complex environmental permitting process as the planned pipeline would cross waterways and national forest lands. The project’s approval came after a bipartisan group of lawmakers filed an emergency request to include the project in the debt ceiling negotiations, which eliminates the ability to challenge the pipeline in court (AP News, 2023; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2023).

In September 2023, the government published new, stricter rules for offshore oil and gas leasing as part of the next iteration of its offshore leasing programme for 2024–2029 (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2023). During this five-year period, only three areas of the Gulf of Mexico will be auctioned to fossil fuel companies. The drafting of the updated leasing programme was delayed by litigation from several states, oil and gas companies, and environmental groups (U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, 2022).

State-level action to end fossil fuel production

California is the only oil and gas producing state that has moved to end production. The state banned new fracking permits from 2024 and plans to phase out oil production by 2045. California is a founding associate member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which was introduced at COP26. Washington state joined BOGA at COP27 in 2022 and has implemented measures to ban new fossil infrastructure, including oil refineries (Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, 2021, 2022). The US did not join BOGA at its founding at COP26 and has since not joined the alliance.

Abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells: a lasting legacy of carbon pollution

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes a USD 21bn investment to plug and clean up abandoned coal mines and oil and gas wells, which continue to emit significant amounts of methane and other pollutants long after remission (U.S. Senate, 2021). This investment was increased by USD 5bn by the Biden Administration after its negotiation in the US Congress.

In August 2022, the DOI awarded USD 560m to 24 states to begin work on monitoring and capping methane emissions from orphaned oil and gas wells (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2022). This initiative is further supported through the IRA’s Methane Emissions Reductions Program, under which the Biden Administration announced an additional USD 350m in the first of a series of grants for states to measure and reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The programme includes funding for plugging and cleaning up abandoned well sites (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022a).


## Industry

Direct GHG emissions from industry accounted for 23% of total US emissions in 2023, making it the third largest contributor to US GHG emissions after the transport and electricity sectors.

In 2020, emissions from the industrial sector decreased by 6% due to the economic impacts of the pandemic. In 2021, sectoral emissions increased by 1% as a result of the economy’s recovery. In 2022, emissions remained stable, indicating that the sector’s emissions have not reached pre-pandemic levels again. (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n)

Industrial emissions have remained largely stable over the past decade, even as the US economy has transitioned from a manufacturing to a service-based economy and as industrial processes have experienced efficiency improvements and shifted to less emissions-intensive fuels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024n). Under current policies, emissions from the industrial sector are projected to remain stable or minimally decrease as a result of the counteracting forces of renewed growth in domestic manufacturing and strengthen decarbonisation policies under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (King, Kolus, et al., 2024; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

The IRA funds several measures to decarbonise the industrial sector. The act provides USD 5.8bn in funding for the new Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program. In 2024, this programme selected, and began awarding financing to, projects in emissions-intensive industrial facilities (e.g. iron, steel, concrete sectors). The DOE estimates that the programme will reduce 14 MTCO2 annually (Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, 2024).

The IRA also expands tax credits for carbon capture, utilisation, and sequestration (CCUS) technology, building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s (BIL) investments in CCUS demonstrations and industrial applications (The White House, 2023b; U.S. Department of Energy, 2022f). Estimates suggest that measures under the IRA for industrial CCUS might reduce up to 240MtCO2e per year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023e).

The IRA also includes the Advanced Energy Project Credit, which provides tax credits for industrial and manufacturing facilities that invest in advanced energy projects. Eligible facilities either must re-tool with equipment designed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 20%, re-equip, expand, or establish measures for producing and recycling clean energy equipment, or process, refine, and recycle critical materials (The White House, 2023b). A total of USD 10bn in tax credits was allocated in a first round. A second round in 2024 aims to allocate an additional up to USD 6bn (IRS, 2024; U.S. Department of Energy, 2024f).

Overall, the US implemented a diverse patchwork of financial incentives to support the research and development technologies thar are key for industrial decarbonisation. However, the government has not introduced instruments to facilitate the commercialisation of many of the technologies needed in hard-to-abate industrial subsectors (System Change Lab, 2024). Unlike the EU, the US has not developed a national emissions trading scheme, which, if designed correctly, could help expediate the commercialisation of key technologies.

The challenging economics of many technologies in the industry sector, such as green hydrogen and CCUS,(Department of Energy, 2024) require clear, robust incentive schemes to derisk and attract investment. Individual products, such as clean and/or green steel, might otherwise still find niche market applications (e.g. government procurement), but will likely not be sufficiently commercialised to enable a full sector decarbonisation.

In March 2023, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalised its Good Neighbour Plan, which requires industrial facilities and power plants in 23 states to cut NOx emissions to prevent pollution across state lines. By 2026, the EPA plans to set enforceable NOx emissions control requirements, which will primarily reduce emissions from harmful air pollutants, but reduce CO2 emissions by 16 MtCO2e/year (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023f).

In December 2020, the US Congress enacted legislation under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act to tackle hydrofluorocarbon emissions (HFC), which directs the EPA to phase down the production and imports of HFCs by 85% until 2036. It is expected to reduce emissions by 4.7 GtCO2e by 2050 by minimising HFC emissions through sector-based requirements to transition to non-HFC-emitting alternatives and next-generation technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b).

In 2024, the US met its HFC phase-down target of 40% below 2020 levels (Haroldsen, 2024) The IRA provides an additional USD 38.5m to the EPA to implement the AIM Act (The White House, 2023b). We incorporate the IRA's effects on reducing non-CO2 emissions into our current policy projections through a review of studies that quantify this impact (see Assumptions section).

Hydrogen plays a central role in the Biden Administration’s industrial decarbonisation roadmap for decarbonising hard-to-abate industrial processes and replacing fossil fuel-based feedstock with cleaner alternatives. The IRA established the Hydrogen Production Tax Credit to incentivise domestic production of clean hydrogen and to meet the Biden Administration’s Hydrogen Shot target, which aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to USD 1 per kilogram through 2030 (The White House, 2023b). Recently, the credit has received criticism for its requirements for minimising emissions from hydrogen production, which certain actors argue are too costly (Pontecorvo, 2024).


## Transport

In 2022, the transport sector accounted for 28.5% of total US GHG emissions and, since 2017, has been the largest contributor. Total sector emissions increased by 19.4% between 1990 and 2022 due to increased motorised transport demand: during the same period, the average number of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) per passenger cars and light-duty trucks increased by 46.7%. Road transport is responsible for the vast majority of transport sector emissions in the US: light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks and passenger cars accounted for 79.8% of total sectoral emissions in 2022 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024j).

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes several components to decarbonise the transport sector, such as investments to improve roads, modernise public transit, and boost the EV market (U.S. Senate, 2021). The BIL includes measures to develop EV charging stations (USD 7.5 bn), strengthen the country’s battery supply chain (USD 7bn), update public transit (USD 39bn), build out ‘climate-friendly’ passenger and freight railways (USD 66bn), and invest in roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure projects (USD 110bn), as well as in clean busses and ferries (USD 7.5bn).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), alongside significant investments in electrifying light- and heavy-duty vehicles (see below), provides considerable financial support for EV manufacturing and supply chains: the IRA sets aside USD 2bn for the Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant Program, which will fund the retooling of production lines for EVs. The act allocates another USD 3bn for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which has expanded coverage to heavy-duty vehicles, locomotives, maritime vessels, and planes. As a result, plans for 163 new battery and 117 EV manufacturing plants have been announced.

If fully realised, these plants would create over 170,000 new jobs in battery and EV manufacturing and account for over 60% of all new jobs created by the IRA (Climate Power, 2024b). By 2030, if all planned manufacturing plants are operationalised, domestic battery manufacturing capacity is estimated to increase by nearly 20 times to approximately 1000 GWh/year relative to 55 GWh/year in 2021 (U.S. Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, 2023).

The IRA also extends the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit to spur the domestic production and sale of clean energy components, including certain EV-relevant battery components and critical minerals (The White House, 2023b). Through these measures, the IRA is expected to reduce transport sector emissions by 15%–35% in 2035 relative to 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d). In combination with existing policies and the BIL, the IRA is estimated to reduce overall GHG emissions by 1,150 MMTCO2e in 2030 in comparison to business-as-usual scenarios; the result is that GHG emissions are forecasted to be 40% lower in 2030 than in 2005 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022g).

In January 2023, the Biden Administration released its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation to support the 2050 economy-wide net zero target and the 2050 80%–100% emissions reduction target for the transport sector. Its three key strategies align with the Avoid, Shift, and Improve (ASI) framework: the strategy supports community design and land-use planning, expands access to more efficient public and private transport, and facilitates the transition to zero emission vehicles and fuels (U.S. Department of Energy et al., 2023).

The modal split for passenger transport has been and continues to be dominated by road transport. In 2022, nearly 70% of all commutes were undertaken by single-occupancy vehicles, while only approximately 9% of commuters carpooled. The share of single-occupancy vehicle commutes decreased by over 10% between 2018 to 2022. During the same period, and likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of the population working from home increased by nearly 10%. In 2022, approximately 6% of commuters used public transport and engaged active mobility (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2022).

Emissions standards

In March 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty vehicles. The standards, which will phase in from 2027 through 2032, set fleet-wide CO2 emissions targets for auto manufacturers. For light-duty vehicles, the fleet-wide average target is 170 CO2 grams/mile in 2027. By 2032, the average target for light-duty fleets will be reduced to 85 CO2 grams/mile (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024l).

To meet the 2032 target, the EPA estimates that auto manufacturers will produce between 30-56% battery electric vehicles to meet the average emissions target (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024m). The resulting emissions reduction are approximated to total 7.2bn tons of CO2 through 2055 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024b).

The efforts are somewhat undermined by the fact that medium-duty vehicles—a vehicle segment that includes vans and pickup trucks and represented nearly 20% of the total US light- and medium-duty vehicle fleet in 2021—are subject to a different, less demanding set of emission standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022a).

Although the updated standards are the most stringent in US history, the standards are less ambitious than equivalent regulations in the EU and the UK, where the emissions target for 2035 is 0 CO2 grams/mile for new light-duty vehicles (The International Council on Clean Transportation, 2024). The relative weakness of the US standards may be partially attributable to lobbying efforts from auto manufacturers. The EPA initially proposed more ambitious fleet-wide average targets between 2027 and 2032, but the auto lobby, spearheaded by Toyota's push for more flexibility in achieving the emissions targets, successfully watered down the standards (Tabuchi, 2024). In doing so, auto manufacturers can continue to fulfil their emission reduction targets with ICE-based vehicles, which prolongs the production and profitability of fossil fuel-based vehicles and obstructs a faster transition towards zero emission vehicles.

At the state level, stricter, more ambitious EV policy has been implemented. California established a 100% EV sales target for 2035 through its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation in 2023. This regulation has been duplicated and adopted by twelve other states and the District of Columbia (California Air Resources Board, 2024). As a result, over one-third of all LDV sales in the US are subject to the 2035 100% EV sales target (IEA, 2024b).

Electric vehicle uptake

The combined sales of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles made up 16.3% of all new LDV sales in the US in 2023. Battery electric vehicles accounted for approximately 7% of new car sales in the US in 2023; BEV sales reached a record of 1.1 million in 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a).

The growth in BEV sales is the result of a larger selection and significant price cuts in vehicles: in 2023, 20 new BEV models were introduced, while the average transaction price for BEVs decreased by over 17% between December 2022 and December 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, the gap in average transaction price between BEVs and ICE-based vehicles decreased to a record low of USD 7,000 before any purchase incentives are applied (Doll, 2024; Kelley Blue Book, 2023; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024a). This means that, once government incentives are applied, certain BEVs are as or more affordable than their ICE counterparts. Beyond increases in availability and affordability, growing consumer interest and IRA incentives continue to further augmented uptake (Inside EVs, 2023).

To reduce emissions from road transport, the government set a goal to have 50% of all new vehicles sold in 2030 be battery electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell vehicles (The White House, 2021c). However, this 50% target is not aligned with the Paris Agreement (PA). To be compatible with the PA, research suggests that 95–100% of sales of new LDVs in the US should be zero-emissions by 2030 (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).

Even with IRA support, the US government estimates that LDV EV sales will only reach a median of 36% in 2030 (with a range of 15%–54%) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d), which is insufficient to meet the Biden Administration's goal, let alone to meet the 1.5°C compatible benchmark (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023a; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

It is important to note that estimates for EV uptake vary substantially: the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Global EV Outlook 2023 estimates that the US will achieve the EV sales target of 50% by 2030 under the STEPS scenario and the International Council on Clean Transportation anticipates the LDV EV sales share will reach 48%–61% in 2030 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d). At the same time, recent US Energy Information Agency (EIA) calculations only project 13–29% EV sales in 2050 (IEA, 2023a; U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023f).

The US did not sign the 100% EVs declaration at COP26. Signatories agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles (Race to Zero, 2021). Despite the absence of the federal government’s signature, many US subnational and non-state actors, including states, cities, and automakers, signed the declaration (UK COP 26 Presidency, 2021a).

In March 2024, the Biden Administration, building on the set of tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration in 2018, increased tariffs on a range of decarbonisation-relevant products and technologies from China. Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles will increase the most: the border tax on EVs will quadruple from 25% to 100% of the import value (Tankersley & Rappeport, 2024). Although politcally significant, research indicates that economic impacts will likely be limited (Sherman, 2024). In September 2024, the Biden Adminsitration, citing national security concerns, proposed a ban on all Chinese connected car hardware and software (Shepardson et al., 2024). If finalised, Chinese software would be banned starting in 2026, while hardware would be prohibited beginning in 2030.

The IRA accelerates the uptake of electric light-duty vehicles by extending and expanding tax credits for both new and used EVs. From 2023 through 2032, the Clean Vehicle Credit provides up to USD 7,500 for new battery electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel cell EVs that retail under USD 80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks and USD 55,000 for all other types of vehicles.

To qualify for the full credit, the vehicle and its critical mineral and battery components must meet certain requirements for assembly in and sourcing from North America or trusted trade partners (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024a). The result of the sourcing and manufacturing requirements is that only 22 EV models qualified for the total tax credit out of the 104 EV models for sale in May 2024 (Lambert, 2024).

Beyond targeting new EV sales, the US government seeks to leverage the maturing used electric vehicle market, which was made up of approximately 400,000 EVs in 2023 (IEA, 2024b): the Used Clean Vehicles Credit provides up to USD 4,000 to buyers who purchase a used electric vehicle for USD 25,000 or less (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024c).

Both the credits for new and used EVs are capped at different income levels to increase the affordability of and access to EVs for individuals and households with lower to middle incomes. Buyers of used EVs can also claim the credit at the time of purchase, which more immediately reduces the purchasing or monthly financing cost. As high costs remain a crucial barrier to EV adoption, reducing costs, particuarly for buyers with lower incomes, accelerates and supports a just transition to EVs (Pamidimukkala et al., 2023).

The government is on track to achieve its 2030 target for 500,000 publically accessible recharging points in 2026 (The White House, 2024a). The number of publically accessible recharging points increased by over 70% to 170,000 stations since 2021 (U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, 2024).

Freight transport emissions account for an increasing share of total transport emissions in the US: the share of emissions from freight transport increased from 24% in 1990 to 32% in 2021 (K. Kennedy, 2023). Trucking accounted for 65% of all freight moved by weight and made up roughly 83% of total freight transport emissions in 2021 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024f).

To mitigate emissions from trucking, the government adopted revised emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles in 2024 (see below). Shifting freight transport to rail, which only emitted 5.7% of total sectoral emissions in 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2023) and accounted for the greatest share of long-distance freight volumes across all modes of freight transport, has significant emissions reduction potential in the US (Association of American Railroads, 2021).

In March 2024, the EPA adopted an updated set of vehicle emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks, transit, and vocational vehicles. The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles Phase 3 strengths the existing emissions standards: heavy-duty vocational vehicles need to reduce emissions by up to 60% more under the Phase 3 standards realtive to Phase 2.

The revised standards will effect HDVs starting in 2027 through 2032. Between 2027 and 2055, the standards are expected to mitigate approximately 1bn tons of CO2 emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024e). In comparison, the EU, which also revised its heavy-duty vehicle emissions standards in 2024, sets a more ambitious emissions reduction target for all new HDVs for 2030, which will escalate to a 90% target for 2040.

As a first step to mainstream reductions in freight transport emissions, the Biden Administration established a national goal to transition towards a zero-emissions freight sector in April 2024. Although the administration has not indicated an explicit timeline for the zero-emissions target, separate action plans for decarbonising truck, rail, aviation, and marine freight transport are to be developed.

Since its adoption in 2022, the IRA has spurred investments and introduced provisions to reduce GHG emissions in the heavy-duty transport sector. Through the IRA, the EPA launched the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicle Program, which was revised in 2024, to provide USD 1bn in grants to states, municipalities, and Tribes to offset the costs of replacing heavy-duty vehicles with zero-emissions alternatives and installing related infrastructure; at least USD 400m of the total funding will be channelled towards communities suffering from severe air pollution (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024d).

The first funding round of over USD 900m opened in April 2024 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024c). The EPA estimates that 70% of the programmes funding will go towards replacing ICE-based school buses (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024a). An additional USD 3bn is allocated to provide grants to local governments, port authorities, and other relevant actors to purchase and install zero-emission port equipment and technology (The White House, 2023b).

The IRA has also introduced the Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit, which defers 30% of the costs of replacing diesel or gas-powered commercial vehicles—ranging from cars to long-haul trucks —with eletric vehicles. A credit of up to 15% is also available when replacing a vehicle with a partially electric alternative. The IRA also allocates USD 3bn for electrifying the United States Postal Service fleet (The White House, 2023b).

Beyond providing tax credits for buyers, the government is partnering with truck manufacturers to further develop heavy-duty EV technologies. Through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, the Supertruck 3 programme, and the Million Mile Fuel Cell Truck consortium, the US Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting the research and development of next generation of heavy-duty batteries and fuel cells (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022c).

The government is also funding commerical EV demonstration projects. In 2023, the DOE awarded over USD 7m to seven projects that will develop a medium- and heavy-duty rechagring station cooridor across 23 states. In 2024, the government announced that the DOE would fund the research and development of load management strategies to alleviate recharging-related grid capacity challenges.

Federal government support for commercial EV uptake has been supplemented by state action. New York and California provide additional purchase incentives of over USD 100,000 on top of the IRA’s mechanism. In response, adoption of heavy-duty EVs seems to be increasing: delivery van fleets are quickly electrifying as Amazon, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Walmart place major EV orders. Commerical production by Volvo and Freightliner of electric tractor trailers, or 18-wheelers, began in 2023.

Although there are promising signs of increasing implementation, only 1.5% of all commerical heavy-duty vehicles in the US were BEVs or PHEVs in September 2023. At the same point in time, the share of BEVs and PHEVs in the HDV fleets in Europe and China amounted to over 7% and 10%, respectively (Soulopoulos, 2023).

The IRA also seeks to encourage the development and adoption of sustainable fuel technologies in the aviation industry. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit incentivises the sale and use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) that reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

The tax credit, worth USD 1.25 per gallon, is progressive: SAFs that reduce emissions by more than 50% are eligible for an additional USD 0.01 per gallon for each extra percent that the reduction exceeds 50% (up to USD 0.50 per gallon) (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022e). The Act additionally provides nearly USD 300m in grants to develop and deploy projects related to sustainable aviation fuel and low-emission aviation technologies (The White House, 2023b).

Although the US produced nearly 16m gallons of SAFs in 2022, these fuels accounted for less than 0.1% of the total fuel used by US airlines (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2023). Additionally, analysis suggests that currently available SAFs do not reduce emissions across the fuels’ full lifecycles given their emissions and agricultural resource-intensive production methods (Lashof & Denvir, 2024).


## Buildings

In 2022, direct GHG emissions from buildings accounted for 13.5% percent of total US GHG emissions; 7.3% of the sector’s emissions came from commercial buildings and 6.2% from residential buildings. When accounting for indirect, electricity-related emissions, the buildings sector made up almost a third (31.1%) of the country’s total GHG emissions in 2022. Since 2005, total emissions—the combination of direct and indirect emissions—from residential and commercial buildings have decreased by approximately 25%. However, direct emissions from buildings have remained nearly constant since 2005 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024j).

The Biden Administration aims to reduce emissions from buildings by 65% in 2035 and by 90% in 2050 compared to 2005 emissions levels. However, to be 1.5°C compatible, the CAT estimates that emissions from buildings in the US should already be 60% lower in residential buildings and 70% lower in commercial buildings by 2030 compared to 2015 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021a, 2021b). Achieving these levels of emissions reductions requires the complete phase-out of new fossil fuel-based energy supply installations in buildings and the rapid retrofitting of the existing housing stock to improve energy efficiency.

Developing and implementing building codes is largely the responsibility of state and local authorities. The federal government’s ability to regulate emissions from buildings is limited; the federal government can directly regulate federal buildings and, otherwise, can only provide financial support and technical guidance for state and local governments.

In April 2024, the US Department of Energy (DOE) released a national strategy to guide the decarbonisation of the building sector by 2050, which emphasises the federal government’s role in coordinating and supporting subnational governments in reaching this target (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a). The strategy outlines key actions, performance targets, and barriers to increase building energy efficiency, accelerate on-site emissions reductions, transform the grid edge, and minimise embodied lifecycle emissions.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) includes USD 225m for state and local implementation of energy codes. Albeit limited in comparison with other funding sums under the BIL, these resources have largely gone towards the Resilient and Efficient Codes Implementation programme to support energy code adoption, enforcement, training, and technical assistance at the subnational level. In 2022, the DOE released a new building energy code for federal buildings that aims to improve energy efficiency (The White House, 2022b).

The Biden Administration’s National Initiative to Advance Building Codes unlocked USD 1bn in IRA grants to further support for state and local governments in the adoption of the latest building codes and energy efficiency standards. The initiative aims to provide technical and financial support to state and local governments to modernise building codes in underserved communities, to enhance resilience to increasingly severe weather impacts, to increase household savings on utility bills, and, in turn, to further reduce residential GHG emissions.

In June 2024, the DOE released its National Definition for a Zero Emissions Building (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024e). According to the definition, a net zero energy building (nZEB) must be highly energy efficient, cannot emit greenhouse gases on-site, and is powered entirely by clean energy. It is important to note that this definition is not a binding, regulatory standard. Instead, the definition is intended to support and guide public and private sectors in decarbonising new and existing commercial and residential buildings.

At the state level, only California and Massachusetts have set targets for nZEBs in their building codes (Massachusetts State, 2022; State of California Public Utilities Commission, 2021). Due to its limited jurisdiction regarding building codes, the federal government has only set a net zero target for federal buildings (see federal buildings section below). In contrast, the EU, which is similarly legally constrained in implementing building codes, requires Member States to set domestic regulations for all new buildings to be zero emissions by 2030 and for the entire building stock to be zero emissions by 2050.

Given that the average lifetime of residential buildings over 60 years (Aktas & Bilec, 2012), renovating and converting existing buildings into nZEBs is key to mitigating emissions from the sector. To encourage net zero renovations, the federal government provides financial incentives. However, the government does not clearly define or provide guidance on the process of converting buildings to net zero structures.

In comparison, the EU provides a step-by-step, long-term guide for deep, net zero renovations through its Building Renovation Passport; the guidelines make the renovation process more accessible to homeowners and, in turn, expediate the transition to nZEBs (European Commision, 2024).

As it stands, the decarbonisation of buildings in the US will mainly rely on financial incentives for energy efficiency improvements, which, as a result, may have to rely heavily on the electrification of buildings and put more pressure on the power sector. Modelling work by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hints at the building sector’s dependency on electrification for decarbonisation: under the IRA, total emissions from buildings will decrease significantly by 2035 as the share of electricity in final energy consumption is expected to increase by nearly 5% between 2025 and 2035 (in contrast, to an increase of only 2% in the absence of the IRA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023b). At the same time, direct emissions from fuel combustion will likely remain stable; indicating that reductions in total emissions seem to be driven by a decrease in indirect, end-use electricity emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d).

Through the BIL, the government allocated USD 3bn to support energy efficiency and electrification upgrades in homes (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022b). The 2022 IRA builds on the BIL by unlocking nearly USD 9bn for states and Tribes to support consumer home energy rebate programmes; specifically, for programmes related to retrofitting buildings and purchasing high-efficiency electronic appliances in lower-income communities (The White House, 2023b).

The incentives aim to simultaneously reduce energy costs for homeowners and emissions from residential buildings. Via IRA funding, households that retrofit their homes and reduce energy use by at least 35% are eligible for a tax rebate worth USD 4,000. Multifamily structures can qualify for up to USD 400,000.

To further incentivise home energy improvements, the government provides tax rebates for energy efficiency upgrades, such as for installing heat pumps, insulation, doors, and windows, and for investing in residential clean energy, including rooftop solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage (U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2024b).

Beyond supporting residential building upgrades, the IRA targets energy use in commercial buildings by providing tax deductions for buildings that increase their energy efficiency by at least 25% (The White House, 2023b). The BIL introduced the Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund Capitalization Grant Program (RLF), which channels USD 250m to states to establish revolving loan funds. With these funds, states can provide loans, grants, and technical assistance for energy upgrades and retrofits in commercial and residential buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2022d, 2024d).

Embodied life-cycle carbon emissions of construction and building materials are a significant contributor to GHG emissions: embodied carbon is estimated to make up approximately 14% of building emissions (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024a) and as much as 6% of total national emissions (Huynh et al., 2023).

However, there is a lack of standardised, high-quality data on embodied emissions and the federal government does not publicly release data on them. Nevertheless, the government, under the IRA, has taken steps to reduce embodied emissions in buildings. In 2023, the IRA allocates USD 100m to develop standardised labels for lower-embodied carbon building materials, as well as USD 2.15bn for 150 construction projects that employ types of asphalt, concrete, glass, and steel with low embodied carbon (Chase, 2024).

Energy efficiency standards for consumer products and appliances in the US are generally ambitious; a 2023 review of the stringency of minimum energy performance standards determined that the federal government’s energy standards for electric motors, refrigerators, and water heaters meet or exceed international best practice (Mavandad & Malinowski, 2023).

The EPA’s voluntary energy efficiency labelling programme, ENERGY STAR, supports the government’s efficiency standards. The programme labels efficient products, as well as residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and, in 2020, is estimated to have reduced emissions by 400 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to a 5% reduction in total national emissions (ENERGY STAR, 2023).

In 2022, the Biden Administration took over 100 actions to strengthen energy efficiency standards for a broad range of products, including household products and appliances, as well as commercial and industrial equipment. The updated standards will reduce GHG emissions by an estimated 2.4 GtCO2e over the next 30 years, or around 80 MtCO2e/year (The White House, 2022c).

In 2023 and 2024, the DOE finalised new standards for refrigerators and freezers, air conditioners and cleaners, and clothes washers and dryers. In combination, these new standards are expected to reduce emissions by an average of 19.9 MtCO2e per year over the next 30 years (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023b, 2023a, 2024c). In total, the revised standards for these products will reduce household and business energy costs by USD 8.7bn per year.

The federal government is the largest energy consumer in the US and federal buildings are a principal source of the government’s emissions (Council on Environmental Quality, 2024). In April 2024, the DOE amended its energy performance standards for the new construction and renovation of federal buildings (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024b). The revised standards explicitly require federal buildings to significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels: federal agencies must reduce their fossil fuel use in new construction and major renovation projects by 90% between FY2025 and FY2029. The standards mandate that the on-site use of fossil fuels is eliminated by 2030 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2024g).

In 2021, President Biden established through Executive Order numerous targets for federal operations and procurement, including reaching net zero emissions in the federal buildings portfolio by 2045 and reducing federal buildings emissions by 50% by 2032 (The White House, 2021a). In 2022, the Biden Administration issued implementing instructions on the Executive Order, which detailed the agency planning, reporting requirements, and accountability mechanism to achieve such targets (The White House Council on Environmental Quality, 2022).


## Agriculture

Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector made up 9% of US emissions in 2022. Between 1990 and 2022 agriculture emissions have increased by 8%, primarily from the growth of the livestock sector and the intensification of farming practices. Nitrous oxide emissions from soils made up half of agricultural emissions, with enteric fermentation and manure management from livestock represented other significant sources.

Agricultural emissions decreased in 2022 compared to the previous year. However, this decrease was not the result of new policy, but is rather attributable to the decline in herd size—the smallest since the 1960s—due to drought conditions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k).

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates USD 19.5bn for mitigation activities in the agriculture sector. The act mainly boosts the funding of existing conservation programmes, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) (Monke et al., 2022).

Both programmes offer financial and technical support to farmers to implement climate-friendly practices, including nutrient management, cover crops, low or no-tillage, and agroforestry. Historically, farmers have struggled to access funding under such programmes due to high demand and limited institutional capacity. These barriers could potentially be addressed by better distributing programme spending (e.g. by capping funds per farm), limiting the funding that goes to ineffective conservation practices, and increasing agency resources (Happ, 2023; Tham, 2023).

However, the efficacy of existing programmes to address on-farm emissions has come into question. Only one-fifth of total EQIP spending reportedly went towards the implementation of agricultural practices that directly reduce GHG emissions in 2019 and 2020 (Schechinger, 2022). While programmes like EQIP and CSP are now bolstered by IRA funding, they still face structural issues that impede climate mitigation.

This year, 15 new practices were added to the 'climate-smart' category under the EQIP, but many of the new practices do not have proven climate benefits. A significant portion of the funding also goes towards manure management practices, including biodigesters that convert manure into biogas, which can be sold for profit and, therefore, may incentivise farmers to maintain or increase their herd sizes (Happ, 2024; Schechinger, 2024).

The IRA has also funded several programmes to support renewable energy use in the agriculture sector, including loans and grants for farmers who implement energy efficient equipment or underutilised renewable energy technologies (The White House, 2023b). However, certain provisions of these programmes could lead to perverse incentives. For instance, the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) subsidises biogas production. However, in combination with existing state subsidies for cattle farmers to produce biomass, REAP’s subsidies could lead to intensified livestock production (Sainato, 2022).

The Farm Bill is a policy that heavily influences farmers’ decisions on what food to produce and how to produce it. The 2018 bill expired last year, but was temporarily extended through FY2024. Its official renewal was pushed to 2024 since Congress could not come to an agreement on the contents of the new bill.

In 2024, the Republican-led House Committee on Agriculture released a draft bill that could deter climate progress in the agriculture sector. The bill would reallocate up to USD 14.4bn from the IRA that is specifically meant for climate-friendly farming practices to cover all conservation practices. The bill would also reinstate the requirement that 50% of EQIP funds are channelled to livestock operations (House Committee on Agriculture, 2024). However, the fate of the Farm Bill and its contents remain unclear as it has yet to arrive on the House floor.

There are still considerable policy gaps in addressing agricultural emissions. Beyond the structural issues of existing programmes (i.e. EQIP, CSP), the US lacks regulations or plans for addressing emissions from animal production. There are no incentives for reducing the volume of animal agriculture or for promoting plant-based foods and crops (CBD, 2020). Instead, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), which are detrimental to animal and environmental welfare, continue to be subsidised by the government (Happ, 2024).

The government also lacks policies on the demand-side. The US has one of the highest rates of meat and dairy consumption in the world, but food consumption patterns have not been addressed by the government. Historically, the meat industry has lobbied against key demand-side policies, such as changes to dietary guidelines, which constitute the basis of federal nutrition programmes and policy (Bottemiller Evich, 2016; Sebastian, 2024). Without a shift in diets, related emissions may increase by 9% in the US as a result of population growth (Heller et al., 2020).

The volume of food waste in the US is very high. Approximately one-third of available food is lost or wasted. Surplus, wasted food results in significant embodied emissions across the supply chain, and has been estimated to account for 6% of the country’s total GHG emissions (Harwood et al., 2023). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a goal to halve food loss and waste by 2030.

However, the target puts little focus on food losses, which occur during the production and processing stages, due to a lack of data (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o). The US is not on track to reach this target due to insufficient federal and state-level policies. Interventions to prevent food waste, such as policies on date labels, are insufficient. At the subnational level, some states hinder the recycling of food waste through bans on diverting food waste streams towards animal feed (ReFED, 2024).


## Forestry

In 2022, the net CO2 removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector corresponded to roughly 15% of total US GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, the net carbon removal in the sector decreased by 13% due to the declining rate of net carbon accumulation in forests and on cropland, as well as an increase in emissions from urbanisation (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k).

Maintaining and increasing the carbon sink is an important component of the US government’s NDC and net zero targets. The government is a signatory of COP26’s forestry pledge, and the New York Declaration of Forests, which aims to halt natural forest loss by 2030, improve and expanding forest finance and governance, and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Forest Declaration Platform, 2022).

Although the government has pledged to preserve and expand its natural carbon sink in national policies and international negotiations, a recent study published by the US Forest Service raises concerns about the potential of US forests to store carbon in the long term. A decrease in forest area from land conversion, an increased demand for timber products, and a higher frequency of natural disturbances from climate change are reducing the ability of US aging forests to sequester carbon. Under a high wood demand scenario, US forests could even become a carbon source by 2070 (U.S. Forest Service, 2023).

To circumvent such risks, the US needs more robust forest management practices and policies. Current afforestation rates are insufficient to maintain current levels of CO2 removal, let alone meet the values presented in the government’s long-term strategy (LTS). Further incentivisation is needed to expand forest area, which is especially challenging on private lands (Wear & Wibbenmeyer, 2023).

Although afforestation has the largest potential to improve the carbon sink, more can be done to increase the average carbon stocks of managed forests, such as extending harvests or rotation ages. Increased investments in fire suppression and post-wildfire reforestation are necessary to mitigate wildfires and reduce their severity, which is exacerbated by climate change (S. Kennedy et al., 2024).

In 2020, then-President Trump reversed a long-standing rule that limited logging in the largest national forest, Alaska’s Tongass National Forest. The Biden Administration reinstated the protections on the forest in January 2023 by banning road-building and logging on the majority of the forest’s 16 million acres (Friedman, 2023). Considering that the Tongass makes up over one-fifth of the nation’s forest carbon stocks, its protection is critical to preserving the considerable US carbon sink (Dellasala et al., 2022).

The IRA has led to further investments (USD 5bn) in the National Forest Service and programmes that support the preservation of carbon sinks and nature-based climate mitigation activities. This includes grants for urban and community tree planting efforts, technical and financial assistance for landowners to boost carbon sequestration on forestland, and support for existing programmes (The White House, 2023b).

The Forest Legacy Program identifies and conserves environmentally significant forest areas that are threatened by land conversion through economic incentives. Landowners can either sell their property to the government or use a conservation easement. The programme has conserved over 3 million acres of forest land since 1990 (U.S. Forest Service, n.d.).

On the other hand, the IRA has introduced some tax measures that could drive biomass production and accelerate logging if inputs are not well-managed. Certain tax incentives for clean energy production and subsidies for advanced manufacturing equipment, as well as tax credits for carbon capture technologies, could be used by bioenergy companies to boost their production of forest biomass (e.g. wood pellets). The Treasury Department has not yet defined what ‘clean energy’ refers to under such provisions (Bruggers, 2024).

The US Forest Service has separate timber production targets that are highly misaligned with its responsibility to preserve and increase the carbon sink (Talbott, 2024). The agency wants to increase timber production by 25% above current levels, which is higher than any period in the past few decades (U.S. Forest Service, 2022).

The agency cites some of the reinstated protections on old-growth forests as a barrier to increased logging, and also identifies logging in regions critical to preserving high-carbon forests, such as the Pacific Northwest, as key to meeting the target (U.S. Forest Service, 2022)(Talbott, 2024). To reach the net LULUCF emissions removals needed to meet US climate targets, climate mitigation should be prioritised over timber production.


## Waste

The waste sector made up only 2.7% of national emissions in 2021 but contributed to 17% of anthropogenic methane emissions (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023g). Therefore, addressing methane emissions from landfills is a key pillar of the US Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. In 2021, the Biden Administration finalised emissions standards to ensure that large municipal landfills significantly reduce their methane emissions, and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a Landfill Methane Outreach Program to support methane collection and distribution at smaller, unregulated landfills (The White House, 2021d).

The IRA has not led to significant policies or programmes in the waste sector, aside from some funding to improve methane monitoring and to develop a better method to measure fugitive methane sources (e.g. landfills) (The White House, 2023b).

Recently, the EPA has been sued by environmental groups for failing to update its landfill emissions accounting methodology, which it has not revised since 1998. The current emissions factors reportedly underestimate the emissions released from landfills from several pollutants, including nitrogen oxide, by as much as 25%. As a result of the lawsuit, the EPA has agreed to evaluate whether methodology needs updating and to suggest new emissions factors in case updating is required (Quinn, 2023).


## Methane

Methane is an important source of GHG emissions in the US, representing 15% of total GHG emissions in 2022, which are split between the oil and gas industry (37%), agriculture (36%), waste (19%), and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (8%) sectors (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024o).

Alongside the EU, the US spearheaded the launch of the Global Methane Pledge. The Biden Administration released its Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan in 2021. The plan seeks to reduce emissions from all major sources through regulations, financial incentives, and public-private partnerships.

The plan also includes USD 20bn in new investments targeted at reducing methane emissions (The White House, 2022a). The IRA provided USD 1.5bn for the Methane Emissions Reduction Fund, which aims to monitor and reduce emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems through financial and technical assistance, but also potentially locks in new “brown” infrastructure. It also established a ‘waste emissions charge’ per ton of methane emissions to oil and gas facilities that exceed emissions thresholds (The White House, 2023b).

# Assumptions


## Historical emissions

Historical emissions are based on the 1990–2022 inventory emissions developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024k). The national inventory was reported in AR5 Global Warming Potential (GWP) values. We converted all values to AR4 GWP.


## NDC and other targets

For the 2030 NDC target, we apply the indicated target of 50%–52% reduction to the 2005 base year including LULUCF, and then subtract the projected emissions for the LULUCF sector. The LULUCF emission projections in 2030 were taken from the 5th Biennial Report which reported sinks of 0.6–0.8 GtCO2e/year in 2030 (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

For the net zero target, we assume total GHG emissions in 2050 are balanced by projected sinks in 2050. The LULUCF sinks in 2050 were taken from the US long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2021 (U.S. Department of State, 2021). Since the document does not provide exact figures, we have extracted the approximated figures from the graphs in the report. The reading of the graphs results in an approximation of minus 0.6-1.4 GtCO2e/year for LULUCF sinks in 2050, we add this sink to the residual estimate in 2050 to get 0.6-1.5 GtCO2e/year in 2050. We include also estimates for 2040 in our pathway using a similar approach.


## Current policy projections

The current policy projections were generated in five steps:

- First, we estimate the total emissions projections under current policies as the aggregation of the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors:GHG emissions in the energy sector:Energy-related CO2 emissions projections: short-term projections (2023–2025) were taken from the US Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) Short-term Outlook from August 2024 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024e). These projections are harmonised with long-term projections (2024–2035) taken from a model comparison study by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2023d) . The modelling comparison study includes the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It represents the upper range of emissions projections.Non-CO2 emissions in the energy sector from EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).All GHGs emissions in the energy sector result from the sum of the CO2 and non-CO2 estimates as described above. The resulting projections are harmonised to the latest historical year using growth rates.GHG emissions from industrial processes: the projection of GHG emissions in industrial processes was calculated by type of industry and then aggregated.GHG emissions in the mineral, chemical and metal industries were projected by applying projected production growth of each industry in terms of value of shipments taken from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023b), to their respective GHG emissions in the base year. We use two scenarios from the Annual Energy Outlook – the reference scenario and the low economic growth scenario – to create a range of emissions projections.To project the rest of industry processes, we apply the growth rates from industrial process F-gas emissions from the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050, which includes policies that were implemented until early 2015 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b).GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors follow the growth rates of the respective sector in the EPA’s U.S. State-level Non-CO₂ Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential: 2025–2050 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022b). We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.

We did not consider alternative economic growth scenarios for GHG emissions in the agriculture and waste sectors.
- Second, each of the above emissions categories was harmonised to historical data for each sector by applying the estimated annual percentage change from the projected dataset to the base year. The projections for all sectors were then aggregated to obtain total GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF. These projections are the baseline scenarios.
- Third, the quantification of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in non-CO2 emissions and in non-energy sectors:Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.Non-energy CO2 emissions: The IRA also has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in non-energy sectors, mainly in Industry Processes and Product Use (IPPU), which are not quantified in the baseline scenarios. We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Non-CO2 emissions: The IRA has the potential to reduce non-CO2 GHG emissions. The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of this policy on total GHG emissions (Zero Lab, 2024). We use the mitigation potential range of the current policy scenario (including the IRA) compared to the frozen policy scenario (not including the IRA) on non-CO2 emissions reported for years 2030 and 2035 and made a linear interpolation for the years in between and zero for 2022. The mitigation potential is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, whereby the mitigation effect is 90–100 MtCO2e in 2030 and 80–90 MtCO2e in 2035.

We assume that such emissions reductions will be achieved mainly through Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS). The quantification of such impact is based on the assessment of IRA on mitigation potential of CCUS in the study conducted by King, Gaffney, et al. (2024). We assume a range of mitigation potential between zero, to capture the uncertainty around the deployment of CCUS, and the mitigation potential reported in 2030 and 2035, assuming a start of emissions reduction in 2025. We carried out a linear interpolation for the years in between. The resulting mitigation potential for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenarios emissions, resulting in a reduction of the emissions level of up to 77 MtCO2e in 2030 and 85 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Fourth, the quantification of the AIM Act, which was not part of the policies considered in the baseline scenario taken from Global Non-CO2 Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections & Mitigation Potential:Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The resulting mitigation potential range for each year is subtracted from the baseline scenario emissions, resulting in a reduced emission levels of 50–150 MtCO2e in 2030 and 100–200 MtCO2e in 2035.
- Phase down of the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% over the next 15 years. The annual mitigation potential is calculated as a range of between two mitigation potential trajectories for HFC emissions:The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target. After harmonising the projections with the latest historical year, we interpolated the years in between and calculated the annual mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.The second is based directly on the annual HFCs consumption caps defined in the AIM Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a). We then calculated the mitigation potential against the baseline scenario.
- The first mitigation potential trajectory is based on the HFC emissions projection reported in the 5th Biennial Report in 2020, 2030, 2035, and 2040 (U.S. Department of State, 2022), which considers the implementation of the AIM Act, although does not achieve the proposed target.

- Fifth, economy wide emission projections from a newer study published in 2024 by the Rhodium Group (King, Kolus, et al., 2024) were included in the analysis as well, after deducting LULUCF sinks based on the 5th BUR. The study includes additional policies including the impacts of the EPA Vehicle Emissions Standards that apply to vehicles from a model year of 2027(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024l) and the EPA pollution standard for fossil fuel power plant (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2024i). This study represents the lower end of the current policy projections range.

# Targets


## Target overview

In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the US has set a target to reduce emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (U.S. Government, 2021). This target covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (GHGs). The CAT assessment excludes emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target, resulting in a 45%–50% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. The CAT rates the US domestic target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within its borders and as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution.

The US submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, officially committing to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest (U.S. Department of State, 2021).


## NDC Updates

The US submitted its current, more ambitious NDC target on 22 April 2021. President Biden moved to re-join the Paris Agreement on his first day in office in 2021. In line with its re-joining the agreement, the US submitted a strengthened NDC, in which the government commits to reducing emissions by 50%–52% below 2005 levels by 2030 (including emissions from land use, land use change and forestry, or LULUCF).

The CAT estimates that the target would translate to a range of 3,790–4,131 MtCO2e absolute GHG emissions in 2030, excluding LULUCF (or 45%–50% below 2005 levels), depending on whether the sink from LULUCF is at the high or low end of the projections (U.S. Department of State, 2022).

The current NDC target represents major progress beyond the Obama-era target of 26%–28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Nevertheless, the NDC is not ambitious enough to bring US domestic emissions in line with what would be needed to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.

CAT analysis indicates that the US should aim to reduce its national emissions by at least 58% below 2005 levels by 2030 (incl. LULUCF) and provide support to other countries in order to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit. Doing so will also put the US on track to achieve the Biden Administration’s 2050 net zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021b). The US has not submitted an update to its NDC since 2021, even though the Glasgow Climate Pact mandates countries revisit and strengthen their NDCs.

* The ‘Critically insufficient’ rating was based on the fact that the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and was not an assessment of the NDC emissions level, which itself would fall in the ‘Insufficient range’ based on the CAT’s prior rating system (which was updated in September 2021).

## CAT rating of targets

The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what would qualify as a country’s fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal. For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.

The US does not intend to use market mechanisms and will achieve its NDC target through domestic action alone. We rate its NDC target against both domestic and fairness metrics.

NDC target against modelled domestic pathways

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excluding emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry or LULUFC) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Almost sufficient” when **compared to modelled domestic emissions pathways.**

The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that the US target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow the US approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C. Although the target represents a significant improvement compared to its first NDC, the current target is not stringent enough to limit warming to 1.5°C and needs further improvements.

NDC target against fair share

We rate the target of reducing emissions by 50%–52% (or 45%–50% excl. LULUCF) below 2005 levels by 2030 as “Insufficient” when **compared with its fair-share emissions allocation.**

The “Insufficient” rating indicates that US’ NDC target for 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The US target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort. The target is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow US’ approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.

The US’ international climate finance contributions is rated “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve the US’ fair share rating.

We rate the US’ international public climate finance contributions as “Critically insufficient.” The US has committed to increase its climate finance, but contributions to date have been much lower than its fair share. To improve its rating, the US needs to ramp up the level of its international climate finance contributions and accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuel financing abroad (and not only coal).

The US Congress approved a budget allocation for international climate finance of no less than USD 0.9bn (Congressional Research Service, 2024) for FY2024, although the Biden Administration requested an allocation of USD 5bn. As a result of a more stringent federal spending cap, the FY2024 finance provision is less than the provision in the first years of the Biden Administration (Thwaites, 2024). For FY2025, the administration accordingly reduced its requested funding to USD 3.5bn.

The US State Department, however, claims it is on track to reach its pledge to contribute USD 11.4bn per year by 2024, with a projected contribution of USD 9.5bn in FY2023 (U.S. Department of State, 2024). This discrepancy between the climate finance commitment approved Congress and that claimed by the US State department is due to the fact that Congress’ funding only represents a small share of US’ total international climate finance, as other agencies contribute the bulk of financing (Thwaites, 2024; U.S. Department of State, 2024). However, the sources of the US’ climate finance are not transparently reported.

While Congress’ budget allocation does not include any funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the US government has pledged to contribute USD 3bn to the GCF. The GCF is the primary international vehicle for supporting developing countries in their efforts to respond to and build resilience to the climate crisis (DeLauro, 2022).

The commitment of USD 11.4bn per year by 2024 falls short of the US’ fair contribution. While the OECD reported in 2022 that international climate finance provided by developed countries exceeded the USD 100bn goal per year for the first time, a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” post-2025 is already being discussed by UNFCCC parties (UNFCCC, 2024).

To demonstrate global leadership on climate finance and to contribute towards its fair share, the US needs to substantially scale up its international climate finance provisions in future. The CAT finance rating would improve if the US were to successfully augment its level of finance through a sustained upwards trend in annual contributions.

The US has historically provided a significant portion of its climate-related financial contributions as grants, which are more concessional than loans. Climate finance contributions declined during the Trump Administration, but this trend has since been reversed by the Biden Administration, which in 2021 increased its bilateral climate-related Official Development Assistance (ODA) (OECD, 2022).

Bilateral climate finance by the US, as reported as principal and significant financing, further increased in 2022 as a result of an increase in adaptation financing. Principal mitigation financing actually decreased by half, from almost USD 1bn to less than USD 500m, reflecting a shift by the Biden Administration towards adaptation financing (OECD, 2024). Overall, the US' allocation of funding to bilateral climate-related ODA increased from 3% in 2021 to 10% in 2022 of total ODA spending, but remains well below the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) member countries' average of 24% (Donor Tracker, 2021, 2023). This continues to highlight a substantial shortage in the US' financial commitment to addressing climate change through ODA. Increasing these contributions would not only allow the US to play a larger role in global climate action, but would also align with its renewed commitment to international cooperation under the Biden Administration.

The US, along with several other countries, agreed to “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” by the end of 2022 (The White House, 2021b). The 2023 G7 Communique claims to have achieved this goal (The White House, 2023d). However, the US has neither developed plans nor introduced policies to implement these commitments. The US also has not supported a proposal put forward by the European Union to end fossil fuel finance from export banks, which stands in stark contrast to the US commitment mentioned above (E&E News by POLITICO, 2024).

In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the US (EXIM), an independent US government agency that provides concessions for projects that seek to boost US exports, continued to lend money to foreign fossil fuel projects, including USD 100m to Indonesia’s national oil company to expand an oil refinery and boost production. Estimates suggest that EXIM’s total lending amounted to USD 1bn in 2023 (Aronoff, 2023).

While the US government claims to be actively working with EXIM to end its financing of fossil fuel projects, the export agency itself does not seem to take a proactive role in doing so, claiming it has no jurisdiction to end these projects (Friends of the Earth US, 2024). In January 2024, EXIM’s lack of action resulted in two members of the agency’s climate advisory board resigning over a decision on a fossil fuel project in Bahrain (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024). EXIM plans to finance further fossil fuel projects abroad, including in Guyana, Malaysia, Mexico, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea (Friends of the Earth US, 2024).

Although the US has not approved any new domestic coal projects in more than a decade (Friedman & Tabuchi, 2024), the US continues to support existing coal projects abroad, such as the Jawa 9-10 Suralaya Coal Plant in Indonesia and the Long Phu 1 Coal Plant in Vietnam (EndCoal, 2020). The US should stop supporting all fossil fuel developments abroad to improve its climate finance rating.


## Net zero target

The Biden Administration submitted an updated long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC in November 2021, in which the US officially commits to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. The net zero target covers all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes transparent assumptions on CO2 removal by nature-based and technology-based solutions, and specifies several key components for comprehensive planning (U.S. Department of State, 2021).

The US government has several avenues to improve the scope, target architecture, and transparency of its net zero target. The US government could include international aviation and shipping in its target coverage, and explicitly commit to reach net zero emissions within its own borders without the use of international offsets.

The target itself could be enshrined in law in combination with adopting a legally binding review, revision, and reporting mechanism. The US government should further explain how its net zero target is a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels, and transparently address any existing gap between its net zero target and what would be a fair target.

**For the full analysis of the net zero target, click** **here****.**


## 2020 pledge

The effects of COVID-19 induced a temporary drop in emissions that helped the US meet its 2020 targets under the Copenhagen Accord. Total emissions in 2020 decreased by 22% below 2005 as a result of the pandemic-induced economic slowdown. The US 2020 target was to reduce emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 (U.S. Department of State, 2010). Despite reaching the 2020 target, GHG emissions bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.
