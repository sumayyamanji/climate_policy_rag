        "\n## Overview\n",
        "**NOTE:** We have updated our analysis of Türkiye’s net zero target. The rest of the assessment is from our November 2024 update.\n",
        "**Türkiye’s climate policy can be characterised as a blend of the good, the bad and the ugly. A commitment to reaching 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035 is commendable, but that 2035 target would need to increase to 150 GW to align with** **1.5°C. Meanwhile, efforts to increase fossil gas production and become a gas hub, as well as continued coal use, put** **Türkiye’s commitment to its net zero target in question and risk locking Türkiye into a fossil fuel intensive future. The Long Term Strategy submitted in November 2024 allows emissions to continue to rise until 2038, putting the net zero target further out of reach.**\n",
        "**Türkiye’s NDC is far above its current policies and therefore demonstrates little to no ambition in cutting emissions in line with** **the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal.** **The NDC target allows emissions to continue increasing and will easily be over-achieved with current policies, meaning that it does not drive real-world emissions reductions nor the highest ambition policies. Türkiye will need to submit a significantly stronger emissions reduction target for 2030, develop a coal phase-out plan and stop investing in fossil fuels if it is serious about its commitment to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2053. Türkiye’s overall CAT rating remains unchanged at ‘Critically insufficient’, though it has seen an improvement in current policies to ‘Highly insufficient’.**\n",
        "Türkiye’s NDC provides an absolute emissions target of 695 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF) in 2030, which equates to 765 MtCO2e when LULUCF is excluded. It also allows emissions to continue increasing until 2038, which is far too late to align with 1.5°C or achieve its net zero target in 2053 without extremely steep reductions over a 15-year period. Strong intermediate targets between now and 2053 can drive ambition and put Türkiye on a path to successfully achieving the 2053 target. Türkiye should submit a stronger, 1.5°C compatible NDC target for 2030 as well as 2035 which can provide a realistic pathway towards reaching net zero. Modelled domestic pathways show that aligning with 1.5°C would see Türkiye cut its emissions to 310 MtCO2e in 2030, and 240 MtCO2e in 2035 excluding LULUCF.\n",
        "Türkiye’s recently-announced Roadmap for Renewable Energy to 2035 aims to roll out renewables at a rate of “at least” 7.5–8 GW a year until 2035, along with investments of USD 28 bn to upgrade the grid. This represents a sustainable form of diversifying Türkiye’s energy mix. Türkiye has large potential for wind and solar, and both technologies are witnessing declining costs; a trend that will only continue. They therefore represent a cost-effective and sustainable way to increase energy independence. While Türkiye’s 2035 wind and solar target should be lauded as an impressive commitment to scaling up clean energy, without major decreases in energy demand it will not be enough to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal.\n",
        "Plans to simultaneously and substantially increase domestic fossil fuel production and use run counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement, which requires a phasing out of fossil fuel capacity rather than a scaling up. Türkiye is investing heavily in oil and gas exploration, with plans for 270 drilling operations in 2025. If this course is not reversed, it risks locking Türkiye into a carbon-intensive future.\n",
        "Even more worrying is Türkiye’s continued reliance on coal. Despite its severe health and environmental impacts, Türkiye overtook Germany in 2024 to become the largest producer of coal-fired electricity in Europe. However, a significant coal pipeline has recently been shelved as state support for renewables grows, indicating positive steps towards reducing Türkiye’s coal dependence in the longer-term. Given that a coal phase-out is low hanging fruit for decarbonising the economy, Türkiye should commit to phasing out existing coal capacity from its power sector.\n",
        "Recent positive policy developments include:\n",
        "- **The Roadmap for Renewable Energy to 2035** combined with investments in grid infrastructure is an important step towards decarbonising the grid.",
        "- **Efforts to streamline permitting processes** for renewable energy projects from the current four years to two years or less, introducing tenders, and offering a floor price and long-term electricity purchase guarantees to investors: this will improve the regulatory environment for investing in renewables and allow quicker returns on investments.",
        "- **Investments of USD 20 bn to improve energy efficiency** by 16% by 2030: this will take pressure off the grid and support Türkiye in decoupling emissions from economic growth.",
        "- **The introduction of an Emissions Trading System** (ETS) similar to the European Union’s ETS: this will be a central pillar of reducing Türkiye’s industrial emissions. The ETS, which will also apply to the shipping sector, can improve the competitiveness of Turkish industry and provide a more predictable emissions reduction path for companies to follow.",
        "- **Investments in the manufacturing of the Togg**, Türkiye’s own domestically produced electric vehicle, can combine industrial policy with transport policy – providing green jobs and growth while supporting emissions reductions in the transport sector.",
        "To improve its climate targets and action rating, Türkiye could:\n",
        "- **Develop a fossil fuel phase-out plan for the power sector**. Türkiye became the largest producer of coal-fired electricity in Europe in 2024 and is investing heavily in fossil gas, both of which should be phased out of the power sector in the 2030s.",
        "- **Strengthen its wind and solar target** with the aim of bringing 150 GW of capacity online by 2035.",
        "- **Speed up implementation**; in 2023 just 2 GW of solar and just 411 MW of wind capacity was added to the grid. Considering that current targets fall short of aligning with 1.5°C compatible pathway, failing to implement them puts Türkiye even further behind.",
        "- **Set a stronger** **2030 NDC target** **and submit a 2035 NDC** that goes beyond current policies and drives emissions reductions. Ideally, this would be in the form of an emissions limit or reduction from a historical base year.",
        "- **Further improve and substantiate its recently submitted long-term climate** **strategy (LTS).** Pathways that demonstrate how Türkiye intends to reach net zero, developing clear policies with actionable targets and measures, and setting up a review process to monitor progress can improve transparency and help ministries to implement climate goals effectively.",
        "\n## Description of CAT ratings\n",
        "The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.\n",
        "Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.\n",
        "The CAT rates Türkiye’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Critically insufficient”, a rating that indicates Türkiye’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
        "In April 2023, Türkiye submitted an updated NDC target. However, this new 2030 NDC target relies on a business as usual (BAU) scenario which uses a historical base year of 2012. Emissions have grown far slower than emissions under that BAU scenario. The target does not drive real-world emissions reductions, and cannot be considered at all ambitious.\n",
        "Current policy projections indicate that Türkiye’s emissions will continue to grow. Despite recently improved renewables target, without a peaking and rapid decline in economy-wide emissions, Türkiye remains well off-track from aligning with 1.5°C.\n",
        "For a better rating, Türkiye needs to set an ambitious NDC target and develop and implement policies that will set its projected emissions on a clear downward trajectory across all sectors.\n",
        "Türkiye’s current policies and action are “Highly insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C. Türkiye needs to focus on adopting further policies and action to stop its emissions growth and start reducing emissions towards decarbonisation.\n",
        "Plans to scale up wind and solar by at least 7.5–8 GW a year until 2035, along with a USD 20 billion package to reduce energy demand by 16% by 2030 represent positive steps towards decarbonising Türkiye’s economy. However, they are not enough to align with 1.5°C. If Türkiye succeeds in meeting its annual additions target by 2035, it will have 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity. To be 1.5°C aligned, however, Turkey would need to install 150 GW by 2035.\n",
        "At the same time, Türkiye continues to invest in fossil fuels to meet its energy demand, with plans to become a fossil gas hub and expand oil and gas production. These developments stand in contrast to 1.5°C compatible scenarios; to align with 1.5°C, Türkiye needs to effectively phase out fossil fuels from the power sector in the 2030s, providing almost 100% renewable electricity by 2035.\n",
        "Türkiye is launching an Emissions Trading System (ETS) which will play an important part in cutting industrial emissions and adapting to the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, thus maintaining competitiveness for Türkiye’s export-driven industries.\n",
        "Along with cutting emissions in carbon-intensive industries through the ETS, Türkiye is investing in the domestic manufacturing of electric cars and trains. Through domestic production, it is likely that this will feed into higher uptake in the Turkish transport sector.\n",
        "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
        "We rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s NDC target in 2030 reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "Türkiye already achieves this target based on our emissions estimate for 2030 under current policies, which further highlights the weakness of this target. Türkiye should significantly strengthen its 2030 target.\n",
        "We also rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s NDC target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "We do not have sufficient information to assess Türkiye’s climate finance contribution.\n",
        "Türkiye released its long-term strategy (LTS) at COP29 (İklim Değişikliği Başkanliği [Climate Change Directorate], 2024), which reaffirmed its previously announced target of reaching net zero emissions by 2053. If Türkiye successfully achieves this target, it would be a commendable contribution to the global effort to combat climate change. However, as the LTS is currently written, we do not deem it a strong attempt to realise the 2053 goal. We evaluate the target as: “Poor”.\n",

        "\n## Summary\n",
        "We evaluate the target as: **Poor**\n",
        "In 2021 Türkiye announced a 2053 net zero target (Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye, 2021), which was reiterated in Türkiye’s 2053 Long Term Climate Strategy (LTS) released at COP29 (İklim Değişikliği Başkanliği [Climate Change Directorate], 2024).\n",
        "The LTS lays out how Türkiye intends to reach net zero by 2053. Despite its 2053 net zero target, Türkiye’s LTS reiterates the NDC goal of peaking emissions only by 2038 at the latest. This calls into serious question how Türkiye can achieve net zero just 15 years after peaking its domestic emissions. A net zero pathway requires emissions to start falling as soon as possible – not near the end of the next decade.\n",
        "The LTS does provide specific emission reductions in some subsectors, for example in the cement, iron and steel, aluminium, and fertiliser subsectors. However, these subsectors are exceptions rather than the norm. The LTS generally lacks clear emissions reduction targets for different sectors, instead leaning towards specific policy targets without showing how these targets, in combination, would place Türkiye on a path to net zero. Indeed, Türkiye does not provide any underlying models which show how it will actually achieve net zero by 2053.\n",
        "Türkiye’s LTS can be improved by:\n",
        "- Increasing transparency around the target by providing the underlying pathways which show how net zero can be achieved.",
        "- Introducing a legally binding review of the net zero target to assess progress towards achieving it at regular intervals. Such a review process would benefit from quantified emissions reduction targets for each economic sector, against which progress can be measured.",
        "- Explicitly covering international aviation and shipping in the net zero target. Given Türkiye’s plans to become an international trading hub including plans to construct 31 new ports aiming to advance international maritime freight transportation, this is all the more relevant (İklim Değişikliği Başkanliği [Climate Change Directorate], 2024).",
        "Türkiye has a draft version of its climate law, \"İklim Kanunu”, which is intended to help meet the 2053 net zero emissions reduction target (Hürriyet Daily News, 2022; Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024b). However, as it is currently formulated, the draft law contains no interim emission reduction targets between now and 2053 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024b). This is all the more critical to the credibility of the 2053 target, given that Türkiye’s emissions are expected to rise in the medium term (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023). Many of the holes in the LTS can be filled by including them in the draft climate law, such as providing underlying pathways, introducing legally binding reviews, and explicitly covering international aviation and shipping.\n",

        "- **Target year** – The LTS confirms Türkiye’s previously stated goal of reaching net zero by 2053.",
        "- **Emissions coverage** – We assume that Türkiye’s LTS covers all greenhouse gas emissions because the LTS generally mentions that all greenhouse gas emissions are included in its national greenhouse gas inventory, but it does not explicitly state that they are covered as part of its net zero target. All economic sectors (excl. international bunkers) are covered by the net zero target. Given that all GHGs and sectors are referred to in the LTS, we have upgraded the rating from red to green.",
        "- **International aviation and shipping** – The LTS provides no further information on whether the net zero target covers international bunkers. Under Türkiye’s Emissions Trading System, international shipping will be included, though international aviation will not (Aşıcı, 2024; Safety4Sea, 2024).",
        "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Türkiye intends to consider using international carbon markets to achieve its net zero target and plans to establish a national carbon crediting system.",
        "**Target architecture**\n",
        "- **Legal status** – The LTS has been submitted to the UNFCCC, but the Climate Law to enshrine the target into law has not yet been passed as of February 2025.",

        "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Türkiye does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removals, other than stating that it plans to introduce regulations similar to the EU's Carbon Removal Certification.",
        "- **Comprehensive planning** – Türkiye provides no underlying pathways to demonstrate how it intends to reach net zero, nor are there intermediate sectoral or economy-wide emission reduction targets between now and 2053. The LTS introduces subsector targets for the cement, iron & steel, aluminium, and fertiliser subsectors which provide ministries with important goals to aim for. However, the LTS lacks clear, quantified targets for the main economic sectors which could demonstrate a comprehensive approach to putting Türkiye on a path to net zero by 2053. This lack of comprehensiveness is highlighted by the aim to peak emissions by 2038, which seriously jeopardises any realistic chance of reaching net zero by 2053.",
        "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The LTS makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target representing an equitable share of the global mitigation burden.",

The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
        "The CAT estimates that Türkiye’s emissions will be between 537-634 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF) under current policies and action. Türkiye is on track to achieve its updated NDC target based on our emissions estimate for 2030 under current policies.\n",
        "Türkiye’s policies and action rating has changed from “Critically insufficient” in the previous rating to “Highly insufficient”. The rating change is due to an update in methodology of the quantification of the current policies and action range. Previously, our method for quantifying the current policy pathway relied heavily on the ‘With Measures’ (WM) scenario developed by Türkiye for its 2015 INDC with a historic base year of 2012. Türkiye has not updated its WEM scenario since then and states that it does not reflect the current state of its policy landscape (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). We have therefore chosen to update our methodology. For a full explanation of our assumptions behind the current policy pathway, please see the ‘Assumptions’ tab.\n",
        "Türkiye needs to focus on adopting further policies and action to stop its emissions growth and start reducing emissions towards decarbonisation.\n",
        "\n## Policy overview\n",
        "A key feature of Turkish policy planning involves reducing its reliance on fossil fuel imports. In 2022 alone, Türkiye’s net energy trade deficit was USD 81 bn, placing a burden not only on its economy but also leaving it vulnerable to volatile commodity markets and geopolitical shifts (Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası (Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye), 2023; Ugurtas, 2022). Increasing energy independence is therefore a strategic goal of the Turkish government, with diversification of the energy mix central to government policy.\n",
        "Managing energy demand is a first step to reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. The energy intensity of Türkiye’s economy is low and decreased by a further 6.2% in 2022 compared to the previous year (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024b). However, it is also the fastest growing energy consumer in the OECD (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2022). Through its 2030 Energy Efficiency Strategy and Action Plan, Türkiye aims to reduce energy consumption by 16% by investing USD 20 bn in energy efficiency projects (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024b). If realised, these investments could allow Türkiye to decouple energy consumption from economic growth and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.\n",
        "Türkiye intends to have 120 GW of installed wind and solar capacity by 2035. Along with hydropower and biomass, Türkiye’s installed renewable capacity in 2035 will be 160 GW (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024c; Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2022). Meeting the wind and solar targets will involve bringing at least 7.5–8 GW online every year, significantly more than what was envisioned in Türkiye’s 2022 National Energy Plan. However, implementation will need to shift up a gear, as the country is struggling to meet even its National Energy Plan’s targets due to a slower than planned renewables rollout. For instance, 2023 saw the least wind capacity in 13 years added to the grid. Regularity changes including streamlining the permitting process and improving investment conditions are intended to stimulate private investment in renewable energy projects.\n",
        "Despite the improved commitment to renewables, Türkiye is yet to commit to a phase-out plan for coal or fossil gas, which need to be taken out of the energy mix in the 2030s if Türkiye is to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal (Robins, 2023; Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2022). Instead, Türkiye plans to become a fossil gas hub and continue exploiting coal (Robins, 2023; Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2022). If Türkiye is serious about its net zero emissions target, then it will need to introduce a plan to phase out fossil fuels.\n",
        "The most significant piece of industrial policy of the last year has been the introduction of an Emissions Trading System (ETS) in line with the EU’s ETS. This will likely be the backbone of emissions reductions in Türkiye’s industry sector and will help mitigate some of the more severe impacts of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). CBAM will levy a carbon tax on some product groups imported into the EU if they fail to align with EU emissions standards (European Commission, 2024).\n",
        "Ramping up production of Türkiye’s domestically produced electric vehicle (EV), the Togg, and high-speed electric trains forms an important part of Türkiye’s industrial strategy which can support domestic uptake while opening a new revenue stream from exports. Türkiye also plans to invest USD 298 bn up to 2053 in the transport sector. Sectoral targets include increasing the share of rail in passenger transport to 5.31% and to 20.12% in freight transport by 2035, up from 2019 levels of 0.89% and 3.13%, respectively (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure, 2023).\n",
        "\n## Power sector\n",
        "Fossil fuels continue to meet 58% of Türkiye’s electricity supply (Ember, 2024a). Reliance on fossil fuel imports has driven efforts to diversify the mix, though imported coal in particular continues to drain Turkish finances and imperil efforts to align with 1.5°C (Ember, 2024a; Türkiye Cumhuriyet Merkez Bankası (Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye), 2023).\n",
        "Türkiye’s power sector is thus a tale of two stories; wind and solar are on the rise, and coal is on the rise. Just as there are efforts to speed up the rollout of renewable energy, Türkiye became the largest producer of coal-fired electricity in Europe in 2024, when it overtook Germany (Ember, 2025).\n",
        "Continued reliance on coal runs counter to any serious attempt at achieving Türkiye’s stated goal of net zero emissions by 2053, just as it makes Türkiye an outlier on the European continent (Ember, 2024c; Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye, 2021). Meanwhile, Türkiye continues to pour money into oil and gas exploration, with plans for 270 drilling operations in 2025 (Türkiye Today, 2024a).\n",
        "A 1.5°C compatible Turkish power sector does not require a full scale course correction; a renewables rollout has already begun. What is needed now is to double down on renewables by rolling out wind and solar faster – to 90 GW by 2030 and 150 GW by 2035 – while developing a fossil fuel phase out plan.\n",
        "**Coal**\n",
        "Coal’s share in the electricity mix remains on an upward trend accounting for 37% of electricity generation in 2023 (Ember, 2024a). This stands in sharp contrast with what is needed to limit warming to 1.5°C, which would see Türkiye cut coal’s share in electricity generation to 0-3% by 2035.\n",
        "Türkiye has not adopted COP26’s coal exit. Although going into 2024 the Turkish government was openly supporting the exploitation the country’s coal reserves and had approved deforestation in order to expand coal mines, local resistance and legal action have led to the cancellation of vast majority of planned coal projects (Global Energy Monitor, 2024; Global Energy Monitor et al., 2024; Hummer et al., 2024). This trend is emblematic of wider global trends, whereby citizen opposition, mounting financial risks and decreasing investment interest have led to the cancellation of projects (Global Energy Monitor, 2024; World Resources Institute, 2023).\n",
        "The exploitation of Türkiye’s domestic coal reserves – and the subsequent cancellation of those plans – only tells half the story. Although plans to exploit domestic coal reserves were intended to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels, Türkiye continues to be heavily reliant on imported Russian coal. In 2023, around half of Türkiye’s coal capacity was met by foreign imports, racking up a significant import bill (Ember, 2024b). For example, the long-delayed 1.32 GW Hunutlu power plant, whose first-generation unit came online in June 2022, uses coal exclusively imported from Russia due to lower costs (Pitel & Kıraç, 2022).\n",
        "Cancelling the majority of planned coal capacity is a positive step towards weaning the country off coal. The Turkish government should now develop a coal phase-out plan to align with 1.5°C and ensure an orderly and just transition for Turkish coal communities.\n",
        "**Gas**\n",
        "Fossil gas made up 21% of Türkiye’s electricity supply in 2023 (Ember, 2024a). Despite 1.5°C benchmarks showing that share falling to 0-3% by 2035 (Climate Action Tracker, 2023b). Türkiye intends to rely on gas to generate 19% of electricity in 2035 and aims to become a gas trading hub (Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2022).\n",
        "In recent years, Türkiye has strategically focused on diversifying its gas resources. Russia has long been Türkiye’s main supplier of fossil gas. Efforts to diversify supply have seen the share of Russian gas in total gas imports fall from 58% in 2013 to 42% in 2023 (Energy Market Regulatory Authority, 2023, 2024). Other major suppliers include Azerbaijan, Iran, and the US (Energy Market Regulatory Authority, 2024).\n",
        "Diversifying gas supply has also taken the form of increasing domestic production. The discovery of the Sakarya gas field in the Black Sea has been Türkiye’s largest fossil gas discovery to date (Daily Sabah, 2022; IEA, 2021). Production began in 2023, and supply from the Sakarya gas field is expected to grow in the coming years (Energy Market Regulatory Authority, 2024; Offshore Technology, 2023). Oil and gas exploration is a core priority for the Turkish government, with 2024 seeing record extraction and plans for 270 drilling operations in 2025 (Daily Sabah, 2024; Türkiye Today, 2024a).\n",
        "In 2024, Türkiye signed a gas deal with Hungary; this deal represents the first time Türkiye will be exporting gas to a European country that is not its neighbour (Gavin, 2024). While European negotiators have been open to continuing talks with Türkiye surrounding a gas hub even after the collapse of talks related to Türkiye’s accession to the EU, it is difficult to see European investments directed towards a Turkish gas hub in the medium term as the continent transitions away from fossil fuels (Siccardi, 2024).\n",
        "Existing global fossil gas infrastructure already supplies the volumes of gas required. Any addition therefore risks becoming a stranded asset (Climate Action Tracker, 2022). Aside from the risk of stranded assets connected to a fossil gas hub, expanding domestic gas consumption also runs counter to Türkiye’s Paris Agreement obligations. If Türkiye intends to achieve net zero by 2053, it needs to focus on decreasing the share of gas in the energy mix, instead gearing investments towards renewables (Güllü et al., 2023).\n",
        "Aligning with 1.5°C would see fossil gas effectively phased out of Türkiye’s power sector by the mid-2030s (Climate Action Tracker, 2023a).\n",
        "**Renewables**\n",
        "In 2023, Türkiye ranked 11th in the world in terms of installed renewables capacity, with 58.5 GW of capacity already online (over half of which came from hydro) (IRENA, 2024; Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024a). According to the recently-announced Roadmap for Renewable Energy to 2035, Türkiye intends to increase its total wind and solar capacity to 120 GW by 2035 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024c). This will involve bringing at least 7.5–8 GW of wind and solar online every year until 2035, a significant increase on its previous goal of 5 GW of annual additions (Kazanci, 2024; Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024a).\n",
        "This is commendable, and the ratcheting up of ambition reflects a growing appreciation that renewables represent the cheapest and cleanest way of increasing Türkiye’s energy independence. Nevertheless, it is not yet enough for Türkiye to be considered 1.5°C aligned. A 1.5°C compatible Turkish power sector would see wind and solar capacity reach 150 GW by 2035, 30 GW more than its current 120 GW target (NewClimate Institute and Climate Analytics, 2024).\n",
        "Türkiye’s increased ambition will need to spark increased implementation. Since the National Energy Plan was released in 2022, the country has struggled to meet the annual targets. In 2023, 2 GW of solar and just 411 MW of wind capacity – the lowest annual wind rollout in 13 years – was added (Ember, 2024c). Considering Türkiye’s heavy investments in fossil fuels, missing its renewables targets is tough to justify, particularly given the strategic importance of increasing energy independence.\n",
        "To speed up the rollout, Türkiye aims to reduce permitting times for new projects from 48 months to less than two years (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024c). As the private sector is expected to cover the bulk of the costs for the renewable energy transition (Climate Investment Funds, 2024), faster returns on investments should in turn stimulate more investment. A more competition-based model will be encouraged through the use of tenders, and the government will hold a tender for 2 GW of wind and solar each year (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024c). Regulatory adjustments which offer a floor price and long-term electricity purchase guarantees to investors aim to improve investment conditions for renewable projects (EnergyNews, 2024).\n",
        "USD 108 bn of public and private investment will be needed to achieve the target, of which USD 28 bn will go towards upgrading the transmission infrastructure (EnergyNews, 2024).This is designed to expand the transmission system in order to improve interconnectivity for the introduction of greater renewable capacity (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2024a; Spasić, 2023).\n",
        "**Nuclear**\n",
        "Efforts to meet growing energy demand while reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports have seen Türkiye include nuclear power in its energy portfolio (Gesellschaft für Anlagen- und Reaktorsicherheit, 2023). With support from Russia, Türkiye’s first nuclear power plant, the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, is expected to begin supplying energy in 2025 (World Nuclear News, 2024). Türkiye aims to bring 7.2 GW of nuclear capacity online by 2035, which would account for 4% of electricity supply (Turkish Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2022).\n",
        "A second proposed nuclear power plant in the northern city of Sinop has been in the works since 2013, when Türkiye signed an agreement with Japan (Daily Sabah, 2019). However, in 2020 the partnership between Japan and Türkiye to build the 4.5 GW nuclear power plant fell apart (Hürriyet Daily News, 2020). The Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation has given a positive environmental impact assessment (EIA) to the Sinop project, though the government is still seeking project partners (Shaw, 2024). Türkiye is also in advanced negotiations with China to build another nuclear power plant in Thrace, near the Greek border (Nuclear Business Platform, 2024).\n",
        "While nuclear power can reduce the emissions intensity of the Turkish power system, fears exist around the potential impact of earthquakes in the region (Hadjicostis & Mcdermott, 2023). There has been considerable opposition towards nuclear energy as a result, with safety considerations around seismic activity a concern for local communities (Temocin, 2018). The uncertainties and risks around nuclear construction make the technology unreliable in terms of planning the necessary power system decarbonisation, which needs to happen globally by 2050.\n",
        "Although nuclear electricity generation does not emit CO2, the CAT does not see nuclear as the solution to the climate crisis due to its risks such as nuclear accidents and proliferation, high and increasing costs compared to alternatives such as renewables, long construction times, incompatibility with flexible supply of electricity from wind and solar, its vulnerability to heat waves, and security issues.\n",
        "\n## Industry\n",
        "Türkiye’s industry sector accounts for 25% of total emissions (excl. LULUCF) (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023). This share is split between industrial processes (13%) and energy use (12%). The manufacturing industry alone represents over a fifth of Turkish GDP (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a), so decoupling economic growth from emissions will be critical to Turkish industry on the path to net zero.\n",
        "Cement, iron and steel production account for the majority of process-related emissions (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a). These industries will be negatively impacted by the EU’s Carbon Adjustment Border Mechanism (CBAM), which will be fully introduced in 2026 (European Commission, 2024). CBAM places a carbon price on goods imported into the EU. Given that the EU represents an important trading partner for Türkiye, decarbonising the industrial sector will be essential to maintaining industrial competitiveness.\n",
        "Türkiye has announced the launch of an Emissions Trading System (ETS) largely modelled on the EU’s ETS (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a). This is a market mechanism which caps how much GHGs a company can emit, with the cap gradually declining over time. The pilot phase of Türkiye’s ETS will begin in October 2024, with full implementation planned for two years later, in October 2026 (Barut & Kesikli, 2024).\n",
        "Critically, the ETS will also be applied to the shipping sector. By setting a carbon price on emissions from ships entering and exiting Turkish ports, Turkish policy is aligned with EU policy, thus closing potential loopholes which shipping companies could use to avoid carbon prices (Safety4Sea, 2024).\n",
        "The ETS is a central pillar of Türkiye’s climate legislation, and the government has been clear in communicating specific details about the policy (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024b), more so due to its trade implications than climate. Developing clear policies with actionable targets and measures are critical for ministries to successfully reduce emissions. The government’s drafting and communication of the ETS can therefore be followed when developing future climate policies.\n",
        "\n## Transport\n",
        "Transport emissions account for around 16% of Türkiye’s GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF), or 91 MtCO2e (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023). The largest share of emissions comes from road transportation, which more than tripled between 1990 and 2021 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023).\n",
        "In line with increasing road transport emissions, the number of vehicles on Turkish roads has almost tripled since 1990 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a). Nevertheless, there are 161 motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in Türkiye, which is far less than in developed countries (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a). In the EU, for instance, this figure is 560 per 1000 inhabitants (Eurostat, 2024).\n",
        "Turkish transport policy is therefore at a crossroads. As the economy continues to grow, so too will vehicle ownership. Putting in place incentives and infrastructure designed to increase electric vehicle (EV) uptake will allow Türkiye to expand vehicle ownership sustainably. Türkiye aims to place EVs at the heart of industrial policy through the manufacturing of its first domestically produced EV, the Togg (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Industry and Technology, 2022).\n",
        "Türkiye adopted the COP26 declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans, but has not introduced policy at national level with a firm commitment to expanding the market share of zero emission vehicles to 100% by 2040. However, Türkiye does aim to increase the market share of EVs to 35% by 2030 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Industry and Technology, 2022). Its domestic EV production gives it an advantage in terms of meeting the goals of the COP26 declaration, and Togg sales have already driven a substantial increase in EV sales in Türkiye (Kasapovic & Knowles, 2024). A stronger target in line with its COP26 commitment can allow Türkiye to achieve 100% zero emission sales by 2040.\n",
        "Rolling out EV infrastructure is critical to supporting their uptake. The government aims to establish a fast-charging network by providing grant support to private sector actors (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023), as well as supporting drivers’ access to public charging stations at a regulated price (Kaya, 2022). However, EV infrastructure is not being rolled out fast enough. There are 12.5 EVs per charging point. In contrast, there are 3-to-1 in the Netherlands and Belgium, and 5-to-6 in Italy (Hürriyet Daily News, 2024).\n",
        "A modal shift towards rail will form an important aspect of reducing emissions in line with 1.5°C. Türkiye aims to increase the share of freight transport by rail to 20.12% by 2035 and the share of passenger transport by rail to 5.31% by 2035, up from 2019 levels of 0.89% and 3.13%, respectively (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). Ongoing measures to achieve this include significant investments in modernising its rolling stock and constructing new lines between major cities (Railway Gazette International, 2024; Railway Supply, 2024). Türkiye also aims to become producer of high-speed electric trains which it can use domestically as well as export. Similar to the Togg, Türkiye sees domestic manufacturing of electric trains as a way to blend industrial policy with environmental goals.\n",
        "Türkiye had a small LULUCF sink of 47 MtCO2 in 2021, while Türkiye’s total emissions were 517.2 MtCO2 (incl. LULUCF). The sink is diminishing, however, due in large part to the government’s increase in wood production (Climate Transparency, 2022). Türkiye has also suffered from increasingly severe wildfires in recent years (Global Forest Watch, 2023).\n",
        "Türkiye was successful in meeting its target of increasing its forest land to cover 30% by 2023 (Kübra Ağaçyetiştiren, 2024; Republic of Turkey Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2024a).\n",
        "Türkiye signed the forestry pledge at COP26. The updated NDC does not specifically mention the declaration; however, the main mitigation policies in the LULUCF section do aim to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.\n",
        "\n## Methane\n",
        "Methane is responsible for around 16% of Turkiye’s emissions and comes predominantly from agriculture and waste (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). Türkiye has not signed the global methane pledge.\n"

        "Historical emissions for 1990-2021 are taken from the common reporting format tables in Türkiye’s 2023 National Inventory Report (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023). To estimate 2022 emissions, we apply GHG sectoral growth rates for 2022 from the Turkish Statistical Institute’s (TURKSTAT) to 2021 historical emissions for energy and industry, agriculture and waste sectors (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2024).\n",
        "\n## NDC\n",
        "The updated NDC of 2023 continues to use the same BAU scenario including LULUCF as the first NDC and INDC (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023). The CAT excludes LULUCF from its calculations. Since the updated NDC does not provide projections for LULUCF, we assume that the LULUCF sink is the same as what is reported in Türkiye’s 5th Biennial Report ‘with measures’ scenario which corresponded to the mitigation scenario from Türkiye’s first NDC (2021)(Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). We calculated the new 41% reduction target excluding LULUCF using these values.\n",
        "\n## Current policy projections\n",
        "In the previous update from 2023, we used a method for quantifying the current policy projections that relied heavily on the ‘With Measures’ (WM) scenario developed by Türkiye for its 2015 INDC with a historic base year of 2012. Türkiye has not updated its WM scenario since then and by its own admission the WM scenario does not reflect the results of its current policies and measures (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). It is working on updated the WM scenario and is expected to share the updated scenario in the Ninth National Communication. We have therefore chosen to no longer use the WM scenario and construct our current policy projections based on the best available sources.\n",
        "To construct the current policy projections, we use a sectoral and gas-by-gas approach. We start by applying the historical ratio from 2021 of CO2, CH4, N20, and F-gases in the Energy, Industry, Agriculture, and Waste sectors to the estimated GHG emissions for each sector in 2022 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, 2023).\n",
        "For the upper bound of our current policies projections, we apply the Baseline Scenario’s growth rate for total CO2 from the Istanbul Policy Centre’s report “Turkey’s Decarbonization Pathway: Net Zero in 2050” (Şahin et al., 2021). We apply growth rates for non-CO2 emissions from the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) projections to each non-CO2 gas in energy and industry (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019). For the agriculture and waste sectors, we apply US EPA’s total non-CO2 growth rate for the respective agriculture and waste sectors to all gases in those sectors in 2022. While the US EPA estimates are for non-CO2 emissions only, the amount of CO2 emitted by the agriculture and waste sectors is so small as to be non-existent, so we use the growth rates for the sector as a whole.\n",
        "For the lower bound of our current policies projections, we use the World Energy Outlook (WEO) (IEA, 2023). We subtract the EU’s total energy CO2 in the State Policies Scenario (STEPS) from Europe’s STEPS total energy CO2 to get other-Europe total energy CO2 which includes other countries than just Türkiye. Then we apply the growth rate of STEPS other-Europe energy CO2 to historical CO2 from energy in 2022. For industry CO2, we apply the growth rate STEPS other-Europe industry CO2 to historical CO2 from industry in 2022. For non-CO2 from energy and industry as well as all gases in agriculture and waste, we follow the same method as indicated above.\n",
        "Finally, we sum all the individual gas projections and sectoral projections together to have an upper and lower bound for all GHG emissions under current policy projections.\n",
        "\n## Net-zero target and other long-term targets\n",
        "To quantify Türkiye’s 2053 emissions, we assume that Türkiye maintains the LULUCF sink of -70 MtCO2 in 2030 as indicated in its 5th Biennial Report ‘With Measures’ scenario through 2053 (Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2023). This means that emissions from other sectors would have to be reduced to 70 MtCO2 in 2053. As Türkiye’s LTS provides no further clarity on how much of a carbon sink LULUCF is expected to be, we continue to use this quantification method.\n",
        "\n## Global warming potentials\n",
        "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n"

        "\n## Target Overview\n",
        "In April 2023, Türkiye submitted the first update of its 2030 NDC target. Türkiye’s previous NDC was its 2015 INDC, which was resubmitted as an NDC in October 2021 when Türkiye finally ratified the Paris Agreement.\n",
        "The updated NDC has an unconditional target of reducing GHG emissions including LULUCF in 2030 by 41% below a business-as-usual (BAU) projection (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023). The reference BAU projection of 1175 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF) in 2030 used in the updated NDC is the same as in its previous INDC and NDC submissions (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023; Republic of Türkiye, 2015, 2021). The updated NDC’s absolute target aims for a 2030 emissions level of 695 MtCO2e (incl. LULUCF), which equates to 765 MtCO2e once the LULUCF sector is excluded. The CAT rates this target as “Critically insufficient” when compared to both required domestic efforts and Türkiye’s fair share.\n",
        "Türkiye is bidding to host COP31 in 2026. Hosting a COP brings an expectation of ambitious domestic climate action. Considering its extremely weak NDC, rather than highlighting stringent climate action, Türkiye’s bid shines a light on its lack of ambition. Neither Türkiye’s NDC nor its intention to host COP31 demonstrate a commitment to seriously reduce its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n",
        "Türkiye has adopted a 2053 net zero target, which the CAT rates as “Poor”. It is currently drafting its long-term strategy.\n",
        "*For details on what we do for our Optimistic Target global temperature estimate for Türkiye, please see the Assumptions tab.\n",
        "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
        "The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.\n",
        "The CAT rates Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when rated against both modelled domestic pathways and against its fair share contribution. Türkiye has one NDC target. It has not specified whether a portion of the target is conditional on international support or whether its NDC has an international element, so we rate its NDC target against both modelled domestic pathways and fairness metrics.\n",
        "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
        "NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
        "We rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic pathways. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s 2030 target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "Türkiye is on track to achieve this target based on our emissions estimate for 2030 under current policies, which further highlights the weakness of this target as it will not drive real-world emission reductions.\n",
        "NDC target against fair share\n",
        "We rate Türkiye’s updated NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Türkiye’s 2030 target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limiting warming to 1.5°C. Türkiye’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Türkiye’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
        "We do not have sufficient information to assess Türkiye’s climate finance contribution.\n",
        "Under the UNFCCC, Türkiye is an Annex I country and thus not eligible to receive climate finance through the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Our methods do not provide a clear answer for the need for finance for Türkiye. On balance, the CAT methodology shows that Türkiye should receive limited climate finance, if any. Our approach would not expect Türkiye to provide climate finance to other countries.\n",
        "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
        "\n## NDC Updates\n",
        "In April 2023, Türkiye submitted its first updated NDC, which increased the unconditional emissions reduction target from a 21% to a 41% reduction from BAU by 2030 including LULUCF (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023). However, the BAU scenario used for this reduction target comes from its 2015 INDC. This scenario assumes a much faster increase in Türkiye’s GHG emissions from its 2012 reference year than what has actually occurred, making the reduction target easier to achieve (Republic of Türkiye, 2015, 2022).\n",
        "The updated NDC results in a 2030 emissions level of 695 MtCO2e including LULUCF or 765 MtCO2e in 2030 excluding LULUCF (assuming Türkiye’s LULUCF sink is also unchanged) (Government of the Republic of Türkiye, 2023; Republic of Türkiye, 2015, 2021; Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Environment Urbanisation and Climate Change, 2019). This updated NDC allows GHG emissions to increase by 39% compared to 2022 levels excluding LULUCF. Türkiye is easily on track to achieve this target under its current policies, which further highlights the weakness of this target. As it stands, the updated NDC target cannot be considered a serious attempt by Türkiye to reduce its emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C.\n",
        "The CAT rates this updated NDC target as “did not increase ambition” because, though the emissions limit compared to the previous NDC is lower, it does not drive real world action by going beyond the median (585 MtCO2 e) of the CAT’s current policies projection level for Türkiye.\n",
        "Türkiye needs to set an NDC target that will actually drive emission reductions. Ideally, this would be in the form of an emissions limit or reduction from a historical base year. At a minimum, Türkiye could update its BAU to reflect historical developments.\n",
        "Türkiye’s previous NDC was its 2015 INDC resubmitted as an NDC in October 2021 when Türkiye finally ratified the Paris Agreement (Republic of Türkiye, 2021).\n",
        "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
        "Türkiye released its long-term strategy (LTS) at COP29 (İklim Değişikliği Başkanliği [Climate Change Directorate], 2024), which reaffirmed its previously-announced target of reaching net zero emissions by 2053. If Türkiye successfully achieves this target, it would be a commendable contribution to the global effort to combat climate change. However, as the LTS is currently set out, we do not deem it a strong attempt to realise the 2053 goal. We evaluate the target as: “Poor”.\n",
        "The full net zero target analysis can be found here.\n",
        "\n## 2020 pledges\n",
        "Turkey did not submit a 2020 target under the Copenhagen Accord.\n"
