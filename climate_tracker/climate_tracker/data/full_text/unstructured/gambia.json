    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**NOTE:** We have updated our analysis of The Gambia's net zero target. The rest of the assessment is from our July 2022 update.\n",
    "**The Gambia’s domestic efforts to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement are in line with its fair share due to its small historical responsibility and strong development needs, but with international support it could still significantly improve the extent of its climate action.**\n",
    "**At a time when countries should be moving away from fossil fuels, The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil and gas in an attempt to offset its dependency on imported fuel oil. Whilst The Gambia’s reliance on imported oil is a burden on its economy** **and** **leaves the country vulnerable to a volatile commodity market exacerbated by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the most sustainable way to escape this is via accelerated** **deployment of renewable energy and electrification of transport.** **To achieve this The Gambia will need international support.**\n",
    "**Increasing its renewable energy generation and transitioning to an affordable sustainable, renewable energy system would put The Gambia fully onto a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, avoid carbon intensive technology lock-in, and improve its energy security, while also achieving a critical milestone for the country’s socio-economic development.**\n",
    "**The Gambia’s land sector, accounting for one third of emissions, has turned from a net sink to a source, and, if deforestation continues at the same rate, the government warns there will be no forests left by 2050.** **It has implemented policies to begin turning the situation around.**\n",
    "**The CAT had rated the indicative 2030 target in The Gambia’s first NDC and policies as “1.5°C compatible.”** **However, while The Gambia’s 2021 NDC is a progression from its 2016 NDC in some ways, such as expanding sector coverage, the update does not lead to lower emissions than the first NDC due to a revision of the BAU scenario.**\n",
    "**The total absolute emissions level in 2030 is higher in the updated NDC than in the first. As a result, the CAT’s rating of its conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways and the overall rating have fallen from \"1.5°C compatible\" to \"Almost sufficient\". The country will need international support and more stringent policies to meet its NDC targets.**\n",
    "The CAT rates The Gambia’s climate targets and policies as “Almost sufficient,” a rating that indicates that some of The Gambia’s climate commitments are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C, but could be with moderate improvements.\n",
    "The CAT rates The Gambia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair-share contribution. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond The Gambia’s fair share with the help of international support.\n",
    "The Gambia has an NDC target that would bend its emissions downwards; however, its current policies are not on track to meet this target. The Gambia will need to implement more stringent policies to meet its NDC target, for which it will need additional international support.\n",
    "One of The Gambia’s strategies to achieve its emission reductions targets is the uptake of renewable energy technology. After a slow start and delays due to COVID-19, The Gambia is now rapidly increasing its renewable energy capacity with a total of 170 MW in solar PV projects in the pipeline for 2021-2025 partially financed by the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.\n",
    "At a time when countries should be moving away from fossil fuels, The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil and gas in an attempt to offset its dependency on imported fuel oil. The Gambia’s continued reliance on oil is not only a burden on the economy but also leaves the country vulnerable to a volatile commodity market exacerbated by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.\n",
    "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "The CAT rates The Gambia’s NDC target as “Almost sufficient” when compared to the reductions needed within The Gambia’s borders to limit warming to 1.5°C. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that The Gambia’s NDC target is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The Gambia's approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "The CAT rates the unconditional component of The Gambia’s NDC target “1.5°C compatible” when compared to what its fair share contribution is. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that The Gambia’s fair share target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Gambia’s fair share target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "The Gambia’s emissions from Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributed to almost one third of the country’s total emissions in 2010. Until 1998 The Gambia’s LULUCF sector was a net carbon sink, but from 1999 onwards the sector has been a net carbon source (Republic of The Gambia, 2012). In 2000, The Gambia’s LULUCF sector had net emissions of approximately 0.52 MtCO2e, and by 2010 emissions had increased by over 200% to 1.18 MtCO2e (Republic of The Gambia, 2012, 2020).\n",
    "In September 2022, The Gambia submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for “climate neutral” development by 2050.\n",
    "Although the LTS provides a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero GHG emission by 2050, it does not include transparent quantifiable targets for how The Gambia will switch its LULUCF sector from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink by 2050 and only covers 81% of GHG emissions. The CAT emissions reduction target evaluation may improve in the future as The Gambia provides more information on its projected pathways. Another way that The Gambia could improve this rating is if its net zero target were to cover more than 95% its total emissions.\n",
    "The CAT evaluates the comprehensiveness of The Gambia’s net zero target as “Poor”.\n",
    "**The full analysis is** **here****.**\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor**\n",
    "In September 2022, The Gambia submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for “climate neutral” development by 2050 (Republic of The Gambia, 2022). This document outlines The Gambia’s implementation strategy for achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The Gambia’s 2050 Climate Vision and updated NDC also state this target (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b, 2021a).\n",
    "Although The Gambia provides a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero GHG emission by 2050, the document does not include transparent quantifiable targets for how The Gambia will switch its LULUCF sector from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink by 2050 (Republic of The Gambia, 2022). The Gambia’s net zero target does not cover the industrial sector which accounts for 19% of total emissions, but it does cover all gases.\n",
    "To improve the comprehensiveness of its net zero target, The Gambian government chould consider some of the good practice approaches below such as covering all GHG emissions under the target, clarifying the level of net negative GHG emissions coming from the LULUCF sector by 2050, and passing its net zero target into law.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – The Gambia aims to reach net zero by 2050.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The Gambia states in its LTS that it aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Though the target covers all gases, it does not cover all sectors. The LTS covers energy (consisting of the sub-sectors electricity and transport), agriculture, waste, and LULUCF, which represents 81% of The Gambia’s total emissions (Gütschow et al., 2021; Republic of The Gambia, 2020). 95% of GHG emissions is the threshold for a better evaluation according to the CAT methodology.",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – The Gambia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The Gambia plans to reach net zero through domestic actions and will not use removals outside its borders. The Gambia plans to achieve this only through mitigation action in the energy, agriculture, waste, and LULUCF sectors.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – The Gambia included its net zero target in its LTS which it submitted to the UNFCCC in September 2022 as well as in its 2050 Climate Vision and its latest NDC (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b, 2021a, 2022).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – The Gambia specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets. The Gambia plans to decarbonise the power sector, decrease GHG emissions in the transport and agriculture sector, and achieve a net GHG sink in the LULUCF sector by 2050.",
    "- **Review process** – The Gambia is in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for its net zero target. The Gambia will develop a monitoring framework, which will include a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan as well as a monitoring, reporting, and verification system (MRV). This framework will enable The Gambia to review and update its LTS every five years.",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – The Gambia does not plan on using carbon removal and storage, but it does plan on using the LULUCF sector as a net carbon sink by 2050. The Gambia provides a LULUCF pathway but does not indicate how large of a net carbon sink the LULUCF sector will provide by 2050. Currently, The Gambia’s LULUCF sector is a net carbon source.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – The Gambia plans to use the same governance structure that oversees the implementation and revision of its NDCs for the five-year review cycle of its LTS. The LTS also provide high-level cost estimates and timelines for the mitigation measures that it plans to implement in order to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The net zero goal has interim targets for 2025 and 2030.",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – The Gambia’s 2050 Climate Vision explains that the target is fair since The Gambia’s contribution to climate change has always been marginal (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b).",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "The CAT rates The Gambia’s policies and action as “1.5°C compatible” when compared to its fair share contribution. However, there is significant potential for mitigation actions to go beyond The Gambia’s fair share with the help of international support.\n",
    "The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that The Gambia’s climate policies and action are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Gambia’s climate policies and action do not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions.\n",
    "The Gambia has an NDC target that would bend its emissions downwards; however, its current policies are not on track to meet this target. The Gambia will need international support to implement more stringent policies to meeting its NDC target.\n",
    "Last updated: July 2022\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "At a time when countries should move away from fossil fuels, The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil and gas in an attempt to offset its dependency on imported fuel oil (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021a). The Gambia’s continued reliance on oil is not only a burden on the economy but also leaves the country vulnerable to a volatile commodity market (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021a). The illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated the situation by hiking fuel prices (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022b).\n",
    "As The Gambia’s Strategic Electricity Roadmap for 2021-2040 highlights, the country has significant solar energy resources and solar PV is one of the least cost renewable energy technologies in The Gambia (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022a). Increasing its renewable energy generation and transitioning to an affordable sustainable energy system would ensure The Gambia stays on a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, avoids technology lock-in, and improves its energy security while also achieving a critical milestone for the country’s socio-economic development (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022a).\n",
    "One of The Gambia’s strategies to achieve its emission reductions targets is the uptake of renewable energy technologies. After a slow start and delays due to COVID-19, the Gambia is now rapidly increasing its renewable energy capacity with a total of 170 MW in solar PV projects in the pipeline for 2021-2025, with partial finance from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (Bellini, 2020a).\n",
    "The Gambia has an ambitious conditional emissions reduction target that would bend its emissions downwards; however, its current policies are not on track to meet this target. These policies are also off track when compared with modelled domestic pathways. The Gambia will need to implement more stringent policies to meet its conditional target, for which it will need additional international support.\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. Members of the Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seek to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Methane pledge:** The Gambia signed the methane pledge at COP26. In 2010, methane emissions accounted for about 40% of The Gambia’s total emissions excluding LULUCF, coming predominantly from the agriculture sector (Republic of The Gambia, 2020). Almost half of The Gambia’s proposed mitigation measures in its 2021 NDC come from its agriculture and waste sector, thus it is likely that the adoption of the Methane Pledge is not additional to what it had already planned.",
    "- **Coal exit:** The Gambia has not adopted the coal exit. However, The Gambia does not derive any of its power from coal and is not planning to build any plants in the future (African Energy Commission (AFREC), 2019).",
    "- **100% EVs:** The Gambia has not adopted an uptake target for electric vehicles (EV).",
    "- **Forestry:** The Gambia has not signed the forestry pledge. The Gambia does note in its 2050 Climate Vision that if the current trend of deforestation continues to 2050, then The Gambia will have no forests left.",
    "- **Beyond oil and gas:** The Gambia is not a member in the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. The Gambia continues to promote oil and gas extraction and is expected to launch another licensing round (Connor, 2022a; Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021b). This is seemingly inconsistent with its signature of a statement aligning international public finance with the clean energy transition at COP26 along with over 20 countries (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "The Gambia faces a number of challenges with regard to energy supply. One obstacle is that a little less than half of the population remains without access to electricity with a higher rate in rural than in urban areas (The World Bank, 2020).\n",
    "Another problem is The Gambia’s dependence on imported fuel oil which is a burden on the Gambian economy as well as an issue of energy insecurity (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b). Though The Gambian government acknowledges that the transition to an affordable sustainable energy system is a critical milestone for the country’s socio-economic development, it continues to promote oil extraction in the country as a solution to its dependency on imported oil (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021b, 2022a). The situation has been exacerbated by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine which hiked fuel prices (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022b).\n",
    "**Renewable Energy**One of the pillars of The Gambia’s strategy to achieve its emission reduction targets is the uptake of renewable energy technology. The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy took a key step in that direction in June 2022 by validating the Feed in Tariff and Net Metering (FITs) scheme after experiencing numerous setbacks to its implementation since 2013 when the government, with support from the European Union, developed the initiative and model for The Gambia (Nyockeh, 2022).\n",
    "This FiT scheme was part of the Renewable Energy Act passed by The Gambian Parliament in 2013 (Republic of The Gambia, 2013). FITs seek to make the installation of renewable electricity systems more affordable for owners of the system, encourage electricity consumers to become more energy-efficient, and promote the diversification and decentralisation of electricity production.\n",
    "In 2017, the African Development Bank approved a grant for the development of mini grids in The Gambia through its Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. This project supports installation of small and medium scale projects and the creation of governance structures to support renewable energy development (Bungane, 2017).\n",
    "In May 2018, the first large-scale solar PV project (20 MWp), called the Gambia Electricity Restoration and Modernization Project (GERMP), received financing for its construction in the Greater Banjul area and completed the pre-selection process for developers in March 2020 (Bellini, 2020a; The World Bank, 2022a). The project is part of a USD 164m renewable energy programme launched by the Gambian government with financial support from the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB) (EIB, 2019; Takouleu, 2019). GERMP runs until 2024 and includes the 20 MWp solar plant, grid reinforcement investments, institutional and technical support for the electricity sector and off-grid PV systems installed at up to 1,100 public schools and health facilities (EIB, 2018). The EIB estimates the programme will lead to emission reductions of up to 32 ktCO2e/a once fully implemented (EIB, 2018).\n",
    "The Gambian government is also working with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to develop a 150 MW West African Power Pool regional solar power park in The Gambia that could be linked to a battery storage system with a capacity of 100 to 150 MWh (Bellini, 2020b). Due to COVID-19 there have been some delays, but the commission of the project is expected in 2024 (West African Power Pool, 2021a, 2021b).\n",
    "The 2021 update of The Gambia’s Strategic Electricity Roadmap for 2021-2040 highlights the falling costs of renewable technologies, particularly solar PV, and identifies it as one of the least cost renewable energy technologies in The Gambia (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022a). It also promises universal access to electricity by 2025 (Kandeh, 2021).\n",
    "Improved operational performance of the National Water and Electric Company (NAWEC) have led to a reduction in transmission and distribution losses from 28% in 2015 to 19% in 2021 (The World Bank, 2022b).\n",
    "In March 2022, The Gambia launched its first solar mini grid plant. Financed under the ECOWAS Renewable Energy Facility (EREF) with support from USAID and Power Africa, the project involved the design, supply, installation, and commissioning of a 120.6 kW solar PV off grid containerised mini grid with battery storage, grid interface, and remote monitoring systems (U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Office, 2022).\n",
    "Assessing the state of implementation of laws and policies for The Gambia as well as quantifying aspects of its renewable energy and energy efficiency plans is difficult, due to a lack of reporting and availability of data. However, given these developments in the renewables sector, we have assumed that The Gambia is on track to meet its renewable energy target of a reduction of 175 GgCO2e/year by 2030 in its updated NDC.\n",
    "With a combined total of 170 MW in solar PV projects in the pipeline for 2021-2025, the target of 89 MW of utility-scale solar capacity by 2030 is already on track to be met. That being said, The Gambia will still need to ramp up its transition to renewable energy in the coming years, as it had only 2 MW of solar and 1 MW of wind installed capacity in 2020 (IRENA, 2021).\n",
    "**Oil and Gas**The Gambia continues to promote efforts to extract oil in the country in an effort to compensate for the fact that it imports 100% of its refined petroleum products (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021b). This has not proven very successful so far. In 2018, Australian oil company FAR started drilling The Gambia’s first offshore well in 40 years, which was unsuccessful (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021b). FAR continues to look for more drilling opportunities (Kulovic, 2022).\n",
    "In December 2019, the Gambian government signed another deal with BP to explore oil and gas off its coast but the rights to the block reverted to the government in 2021 after BP failed to drill a well before the initial exploration period expired (Reuters, 2019; Reuters Staff, 2021). Another round of oil and gas licencing is expected (Connor, 2022b).\n",
    "While the Gambia lies on a basin with proven natural gas reserves (Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bassau-Conakry Basin (MSGBC)), its own exploration has been modest to date (Connor, 2022b). As the current global natural gas infrastructure already supplies the volumes required, any addition is at risk of becoming a stranded asset (Climate Action Tracker, 2022).\n",
    "At a time when countries should move away from fossil fuels, The Gambia should focus on further increasing its renewable energy generation to stay on a 1.5°C-compatible pathway, avoid technology lock-in, and improve energy security, The Gambia will need international support to do this. The Gambia took a public step in this direction by signing a statement aligning international public finance with the clean energy transition at COP26 along with over 20 countries (UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), 2021).\n",
    "The Gambia’s 2050 Climate Vision cautions that the Gambia will have no forests left by 2050 if the current trend of deforestation continues. In 2018, The Gambia initiated a project that aims to restore 10,000 hectares of forests, mangroves, and savannas, bringing it closer to reaching its 2021 NDC afforestation target of reducing emissions by 0.37 MtCO2eq in 2030 (Green Climate Fund, 2022). The Gambia has also committed to striving to maintain 30% of total land area under forest cover (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b). Overall, The Gambia intends to achieve around 15% of the needed emission reductions for its 2030 target from the land sector (Republic of The Gambia, 2021a).\n",
    "The Gambia’s emissions from Land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) contributed to almost one third of the country’s total emissions in 2010. Until 1998 The Gambia’s LULUCF sector was a net carbon sink, but from 1999 onwards the sector has been a net carbon source (Republic of The Gambia, 2012, 2020).\n",
    "In 2000, The Gambia’s LULUCF sector had net emissions of approximately 0.52 MtCO2e, and by 2010 the sector’s emissions had increased by over 200% to 1.18 MtCO2e (Republic of The Gambia, 2012, 2020). The use of wood fuels, which are by far the dominant domestic source of energy in the Gambia, are a significant contributing factor to deforestation (Republic of The Gambia, 2021b).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "The Gambia’s historical emissions are based on the 2010 GHG emissions reported by The Gambia’s Third National Communication (Republic of The Gambia, 2020). We have completed the time series from 1990-2019 using growth rates from PRIMAP (Gütschow et al., 2021). We consider the government reported data to be the most up to date estimate available and so use it as a starting point, rather than simply using the entire PRIMAP data set. Our estimates are about 0.5MtCO2e higher than PRIMAP.\n",
    "2020-2021 estimates****To estimate historic emissions in 2020-2021, we first derived individual gas estimates for 2019 using the ratios for CO2, CH4, and N2O in PRIMAP. As PRIMAP did not provide data for F-gases, we estimated F-gas emissions in 2019 using the ratio of CH4 to F-gases in the US EPA’s non-CO2 projections (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).\n",
    "To estimate CO2 emissions, we used the growth rate from the Global Carbon Budget (Global Carbon Project, 2022) for 2020 and GDP growth rate for 2021 (IMF, 2022). For CH4 and N2O, we extended the series from 2019-2021 using the 5-year trend from 2015-2019. For F-gases, we applied the GDP growth rate for 2020 and 2021 to approximate the impact of COVID-19 on the industry (IMF, 2022).\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "NDC target values are calculated based on the conditional and unconditional mitigation actions and their estimated impact in The Gambia’s NDC submitted in 2021 (Republic of The Gambia, 2021a). The Gambia’s NDC includes information on the extent to which the land sector is included in its 2030 BAU as well as the extent to which it intends to rely on that sector to meet its conditional and unconditional targets. We have excluded these emissions from our calculations.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "The lower bound of our current policy projection assumes that GHG emissions will grow according to the 5-year trend extension (2015-2019). We have not accounted for any potential policy measures The Gambia has proposed due to a lack of data regarding the status of their implementation and thus were not able to create a policy projection based on the updated business as usual (BAU) projection provided in The Gambia’s 2021 NDC (Republic of The Gambia, 2021a).\n",
    "The upper bound of our current policy projection uses the growth rates from the IEA’s Africa Energy Outlook 2019 Stated Policies Scenario for CO2 emissions and the US EPA’s growth rates for non-CO2 emissions (IEA, 2019; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019). The AEO SPS covers the entire continent. We were not able to find any estimates for The Gambia specifically and thus used the AEO SPS as a proxy.\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potential\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "In September 2021, The Gambia submitted its second NDC which set a new target of reducing GHG emission by 49.7% below a business-as-usual scenario in 2030 (incl. LULUCF).\n",
    "The Gambia has indicated that it will need international support to achieve this target; however, it has indicated that it will undertake two of the mitigation actions proposed to achieve this target using its own resources.\n",
    "The target equates to a 2030 emission levels of 2.74MtCO2e, once the land sector is excluded.\n",
    "Almost all of the unconditional elements of the NDC target will be met through the land sector with a small contribution from renewable energy use. We quantify the unconditional portion of the NDC target will result in an emissions level of 5.53MtCO2e in 2030.\n",
    "In September 2022, The Gambia submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for “climate neutral” development by 2050. This document provides a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero GHG emission by 2050, but does not include transparent quantifiable targets for how The Gambia will switch its LULUCF sector from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink by 2050 and only covers 81% of total emissions.\n",
    "\n## CAT Rating\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C would be, as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders. The Gambia will need international support to achieve the required reductions within its borders.\n",
    "The Gambia’s NDC target includes a portion that is unconditional, that it will achieve using its own resources. We rate that portion against its fair share contribution. The full NDC target will require international support to achieve and we rate that against the level of reductions needed within The Gambia’s border (which we refer to as its ‘conditional NDC target’).\n",
    "Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found **here****.**\n",
    "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "The CAT rates The Gambia’s NDC target as “Almost sufficient” against modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that The Gambia’s NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow The Gambia’s approach, warming could be held below—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
    "We rate The Gambia’s unconditional NDC target as “1.5°C compatible”. The “1.5°C compatible” rating indicates that The Gambia’s fair share target is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The Gambia’s unconditional NDC target does not require other countries to make comparably deeper reductions or greater effort, and is in the most stringent part of its fair share range.\n",
    "The portion of its NDC that The Gambia will achieve unconditionally using its own resources is above our current policy projections for The Gambia, making it unlikely that these actions will drive further emissions reductions.\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "While The Gambia’s 2021 NDC is a progression from its 2016 NDC in some ways, such as expanding sector coverage, the update does not lead to lower emissions than the first NDC due to a revision of the BAU scenario.\n",
    "The total absolute emissions reductions of activities are higher in the updated NDC than in the first. As a result, the CAT’s rating of its NDC and overall has fallen from ‘1.5°C compatible’ to ‘Almost sufficient’. The Gambia needs to strengthen its NDC target slightly (from its current 49.7% below BAU to 53.2% below BAU) to return to 1.5°C compatibility.\n",
    "The Gambia submitted its second NDC in 2021 with revised mitigation targets and additional mitigation measures. It will undertake two mitigation measures in forestry and energy using its own resources. The mitigation potential of these unconditional measures would result in an absolute emissions level of about 5.53 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF by 2030. This is higher than the indicative unconditional target for 2030 in the first NDC (3.8 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF).\n",
    "The total emission reductions of the full NDC target are higher in the second NDC than in the first; however, the second NDC results in higher absolute emissions due to a revised BAU. The new NDC target results in an absolute emissions level of about 2.74 MtCO2e by 2030 (excl. LULUCF). This is higher than the indicative conditional target for 2030 in the first NDC (1.7 MtCO2e excl. LULUCF).\n",
    "The updated NDC has improved architectural elements. It now includes land use emissions, which had not been previously covered. As land use accounted for almost a third of emissions in the base year 2010, this greatly expands covered emissions. The first NDC focused on reductions in 2025 and also provided indicative 2030 targets. The 2021 NDC has shifted to 2030 targets only. The second NDC also reiterates The Gambia’s aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in The 2050 Climate Vision of The Gambia.\n",

    "\n## Net zero and other long-term targets\n",
    "In September 2022, The Gambia submitted its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for climate neutral development by 2050.\n",
    "Though the LTS provides a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero GHG emission by 2050, it does not provide transparent quantifiable targets for how The Gambia will switch its LULUCF sector from a net carbon source to a net carbon sink by 2050 nor does it cover all GHG emissions.\n",
