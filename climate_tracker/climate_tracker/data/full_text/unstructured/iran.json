    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Iran has gone through a decade of economic woes marked by international sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and high inflation. Despite a slight recovery in 2021, the economy is fragile and remains the government’s top priority. Developments in climate policy, including renewable energy, have been limited. Notably, Iran remains one of the few countries that has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement. The Climate Action Tracker continues to rate Iran’s provisional climate pledge and climate policy as “Critically insufficient”.**\n",
    "In its 2015 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), Iran committed to reducing emissions by 4% (unconditional reduction) or 12% (conditional reduction) below business as usual (BAU) by 2030. Iran is expected to significantly overachieve both targets, with currently implemented policies. The main reason for this is the highly inflated BAU scenario it used as a basis for the target.\n",
    "Iran’s economic turmoil has hindered its capacity to address climate change. Investments in mitigation measures – renewable energy deployment in particular– have significantly slowed in recent years, as the government has been prioritising Iran’s economic recovery. This is best exemplified by the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (2023-2027), a strategic document which serves as a guiding framework for annual budgets and policy developments. Unlike the previous edition, the new plan is exclusively focused on addressing Iran’s pressing economic challenges and is completely devoid of mitigation policies or renewable energy targets.\n",
    "The impact of the economic sanctions on Iran’s emissions has been mixed. While oil production and exports have both decreased, some production has been diverted to domestic consumption. In 2021, emissions increased by around 7% from the previous year due to the country’s gradual economic recovery.\n",
    "Iran is not immune from climate change impacts such as droughts and floods, which are driving internal migration. An important first step would be for Iran to ratify the Paris Agreement, and revise its climate pledge, which we interpret as leading to more than doubling emissions from 2010 to 2030, well above what we expect emissions in 2030 to be with current policies. Iran, in its INDC, states that mitigation targets will not be implemented if international sanctions are in place.\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s climate targets and policies as “Critically Insufficient”.** This rating indicates that Iran’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Under Iran’s current targets and policies, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. To get a better rating, Iran needs to ratify the Paris Agreement, set a more ambitious target for emissions reductions, and establish and implement ambitious policies.\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s policies and action as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to its fair share**. Iran has developed few mitigation policies. Some of the policies it had begun to put in place, such as the development of renewable energy, have been slowed down or halted in reaction to international economic sanctions The Seventh Five-Year Development Plan released in 2023 does not include any mitigation measures. Yet, Iran’s policies are sufficient to easily overachieve both its conditional and unconditional INDC targets, as these are based on highly inflated emissions growth projections.\n",
    "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s conditional target as “Critically Insufficient” against modelled domestic pathways**. Iran’s conditional target pledges an emissions reduction of 12% below business as usual, which would lead to emissions increasing by around 125% compared to 2010 levels.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s unconditional target as “Critically Insufficient” against its fair share range**. Iran’s unconditional target pledges an emissions reduction of 4% below business as usual in 2030. The CAT estimates this would lead to emissions increasing by around 145% compared to 2010 levels.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Iran’s unconditional target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",

    "The CAT rates Iran’s policies and action as “Critically Insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Iran’s current policies are sufficient to overachieve both the conditional and unconditional INDC targets, as these targets are based on highly inflated emissions growth projections. Iran needs to implement more stringent policies, but it will also need additional support to do so.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Iran’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",

    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Iran is expected to significantly overachieve its intended Paris Agreement targets, both conditional and unconditional, with currently implemented policies. One reason for this is the highly inflated business as usual (BAU) scenario used as a basis for the target. Under current policies, we expect Iran’s emissions to reach between 1,404 and 1,409 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF). This represents a 77 to 78% increase compared to 2010 levels.\n",
    "Analysis shows that energy consumption could be reduced by 40% compared to BAU estimates in 2030 with energy efficiency measures alone, which would also lead to significant emissions reductions (Moshiri & Lechtenböhmer, 2015). Emissions could further decrease with the deployment of renewable energy and other cost-effective mitigation measures (Yetano Roche et al., 2018).\n",
    "Iran’s capacity to address climate change has been hindered by enduring economic sanctions. Investments in key mitigation technologies, such as renewable energy, picked up during the absence of international economic sanctions in 2015–2018 following the Iran nuclear deal (Lumsden, 2019). However, it significantly slowed down from 2018, when the US withdrew from the agreement and reimposed sanctions on Iran. The Iranian government made it clear in its intended Paris Agreement pledge that its mitigation objectives are conditional on an absence of international economic sanctions (Department of Environment of Iran, 2015). While the government has recently put forward a new renewable energy target, it remains unclear to what extent Iran will be willing or able to pursue mitigation policies under these conditions.\n",
    "In May 2023, the Iranian government unveiled the bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan, a strategic document which serves as a guiding framework for annual budgets and policy developments. Unlike the previous edition, the new plan is exclusively focused on addressing Iran’s pressing economic challenges (The New York Times, 2023a) and is completely devoid of mitigation measures and renewable energy targets. The government even decided to leave out the section on environmental policy, sending a clear signal about its top priorities.\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and others. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% — or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they're not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Beyond oil & gas**: Iran is not a member of the ‘Beyond oil & gas alliance’. On the contrary, Iran plans to significantly expand its oil & gas production in the coming years.",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "Iran’s energy sector is dominated by fossil fuels, which represented 98% of Iran’s total energy supply in 2021 (IRENA, 2022a). It is also the highest emitting sector of the economy, amounting to nearly 90% in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Energy industries are the largest emitting sub-sector, followed by fugitive emissions (such as gas flaring), transport and buildings.\n",
    "Due to the wealth of fossil fuels in combination with government subsidies, Iran’s energy consumption is comparatively high, with consumption per capita far above regional and global averages (World Bank, 2023b).\n",
    "Iran, a member of OPEC, has some of the world’s largest fossil fuel reserves: it ranks second in fossil gas and third in global oil reserves (US EIA, 2022). Iran holds almost 17% of the world’s proven fossil gas reserves in 2021 (BP, 2023). In 2021, the IEA (2021b) projected that for Iran to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there should be no investments in new oil and gas fields. Despite this warning, Iran has been pursuing investments in the sector, raising concerns over potential stranded assets.\n",
    "In 2020, Iran was the world’s ninth biggest crude oil producer, despite US sanctions significantly reducing oil exports (EIA, 2021). Fossil fuel resources remain the backbone of the Iranian economy and one of the government’s main sources of revenues. Oil revenue accounted for 18% of Iran’s GDP in 2021(World Bank, 2023b). The government has made some efforts towards diversification from its dependence on oil exports (Jalilvand, 2017), but this has not necessarily led to more climate-friendly developments. Due to the risk of sanctions, Iran has moved to consume more of its fossil fuels domestically (BP, 2020; Jalilvand, 2017). Most of Iran’s fossil gas is consumed domestically.\n",
    "Despite international sanctions, Iran’s gas production has steadily increased over the last decade (US EIA, 2022). However, the country is currently grappling with a fossil gas shortage, partly due to high domestic demand, chronic underfunding in the sector, and storage capacity shortage. Despite its vast fossil gas reserves, Iran is struggling to meet domestic demand, and is unable to modernise its industry due to economic sanctions (DW, 2023).\n",
    "Gas flaring remains a major source of emissions in Iran. Despite a slow decrease in recent years, gas flaring increased by 30% between 2020 and 2021(Jafari et al, 2023). In 2022, the country ranked as having the world’s third highest flaring volumes (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, 2023). The bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (2023-2027) does not include any targets for gas flaring (The Islamic Republic of Iran, 2023).\n",
    "Iranian electricity generation is dominated by fossil fuels. In 2021, fossil gas and oil generated nearly 95% of Iran’s electricity was generated with , with the remainder generated with hydropower (4%) and nuclear energy (1%) (US EIA, 2022). The share of electricity derived from fossil fuels has increased by 3% between 2019 and 2021. While the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (2017–2021) included a few policies designated to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan (2023–2027) has none (The Islamic Republic of Iran, 2023). Iran does not currently plan to reduce electricity generation from oil and fossil gas.\n",
    "Iran’s electricity demand has surged in recent years, due to several factors including population growth, subsidised electricity prices and fossil gas supply shortages (US EIA, 2022). Iran’s grid is struggling to keep up with rising demand as it is overstretched and underfunded, a situation worsened by economic sanctions and ageing infrastructure. Energy intensive industries such as cement, steel and crypto mining have further exacerbated these vulnerabilities (The New York Times, 2023b). This has led to several widespread power outages (France 24, 2023).\n",
    "Iran has vast untapped renewable energy resources, particularly in terms of solar power. In 2022, the Iranian Energy Ministry announced that it will add 10 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2025, as part of a wider plan to deploy 30 GW of renewable energy generation by 2030 (PV-Magazine, 2022). However, there is no official documents and reliable sources that can confirm progress towards this target.\n",
    "Iran’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Organization (SATBA) signed an MOU with private investors to achieve this target and announced that it would allocate around IRR 30tn (approximately USD 71m) to the first set of projects (Power Technology, 2022). SATBA has claimed to have received numerous requests for projects, in total amounting to more than 90 GW (Tehran Times, 2022). However, there is no information available on the progress of these projects and it remains unclear whether the budget was allocated.\n",
    "Current levels of installed renewable energy capacity remain low, with only 0.8GW of installed total renewable energy capacity from wind and solar in 2021 (IRENA, 2022b). Investments in new capacity have largely stalled as a result of economic sanctions. The Seventh Five-Year Development Plan does not include any renewable energy targets.\n",
    "A source of uncertainty in the sector lies in electricity produced from hydropower. Iran has a significant amount of hydropower—13 GW in 2020 (IRENA, 2022a)—but the production of electricity has been fluctuating due to changes in precipitation. Severe droughts, which have become more frequent in the last few years, regularly lead to power outages in areas supplied by hydroelectric plants. In 2018, production from hydropower was down 36% compared to 2017, prompting the government to cancel many planned projects (Lumsden, 2019).\n",
    "Nuclear energy continues to play a small role in the Iran’s electricity mix, with just 0.9GW of installed capacity (World Nuclear Association, 2023). There is however another 1.1GW reactor currently under construction, with operation planned to start in 2024.\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "Iran has one of the world’s highest-emitting transport sectors, ranking tenth highest in 2014 (Gabbatiss, 2020; Wang & Ge, 2019). Transport emissions accounted for roughly a fifth of Iran’s emissions in 2010 (Department of Environment of Iran, 2017). Iran’s Third National Communication of 2017 includes different mitigation measures for the sector. Iran has notably set a target to double passenger rail transport capacity from 17 billion to 34 billion passenger-kilometres per year and to increase freight rail capacity from 22 ton-kilometre per year to 76 ton-kilometre per year in 2024.\n",
    "Iran’s Third National Communication of 2017 includes plans to introduce 27,000 buses and 500,000 long-range taxis powered with compressed natural gas (CNG). It also has a target to replace 400,000 gasoline-powered motorcycles with electric bikes and 450,000 gasoline-fuelled pickups and 500,000 diesel trucks with CNG pickups and trucks. There is however no clear timeline nor implementation plan for these measures. With the rapid development of electric vehicles, the strategy to move to CNG is outdated.\n",
    "The aging fleet of private vehicles is further adding to the carbon intensity of the transport sector (Financial Tribune, 2018). The car market remains dominated by fossil fuel cars and there are no comprehensive measures to promote electric vehicles or zero emissions fuels.\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "Iran has laid out initial plans to reduce the energy use and improve the energy efficiency of its buildings stock. The Sixth Development Plan (2017–2021) sets a target to reduce the energy use of buildings by 5% by 2021 (IEA, 2021a). It is unclear whether Iran has reached its target.\n",
    "The bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan did not include any mitigation measures for the building sector.\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "Emissions from industrial processes and product use (IPPU) represented 6% of total emissions in 2021 (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). Combined with energy use from manufacturing industries and construction, total emissions from industry represent nearly a fifth of emissions. Mitigation measures set out in the Third National Communication include replacing part of the clinker used for cement production with industrial by-products, including blast furnace slag, and by replacing oil as a feedstock with natural gas in some industrial applications. These measures are to be implemented by 2025, but there is no detailed timetable.\n",
    "The bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan did not include any mitigation measures for the industrial sector.\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "Agriculture is a main component of the Iranian economy, representing around 12.5% of GDP (World Bank, 2023b). In 2010, the sector still represented over 5% of total emissions, but this share has since decreased to 3.5%, both due to a slight decrease in absolute emissions but also due to increases in emissions in other sectors (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023).\n",
    "Livestock, paddy fields, burning of crop residues, and agricultural soil are the four major sources of emissions in the sector (Department of Environment of Iran, 2017). Measures to decrease emissions in the sector include an improved manure management, for example with biogas recovery systems, improving livestock productivity to decrease emissions from enteric fermentation, and by reducing emissions from agricultural soils. These measures are to be implemented by 2025, but there is no detailed timetable.\n",
    "The bill of the Seventh Five-Year Development Plan did not include any mitigation measures for the agricultural sector.\n",
    "\n## Forestry\n",
    "Iran’s Third National Communication to the UNFCCC includes a target to decrease the net emissions of the forestry sector from 21.6 MtCO2e in 2010 to 16.6 MtCO2e in 2025 (Department of Environment of Iran, 2017). To achieve this, Iran aims to reduce illegal wood harvesting, forest, and rangeland conversion by 20% yearly, decrease annual wood harvesting for fuel by 10%, and to increase forest rehabilitation, afforestation, and reforestation. In 2020, forests represented 7% of Iran’s total land area, up from 6% in 1990 (World Bank, 2023b).\n",

    "\n---\n",
    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Historical emissions data (excluding LULUCF) for the period 1990-2021 are taken from PRIMAP (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2023). LULUCF data for the years 1994 and 2000 are taken from the UNFCCC emissions inventory, and the 2010 data is from the Third National Communication (Department of Environment of Iran, 2017).\n",
    "\n## INDC and other targets\n",
    "Iran’s INDC is expressed as a percentage reduction below business-as-usual (BAU) emissions in 2030, but without specifying what the BAU scenario is. In our calculations we have used data points for the 2025 BAU provided in the Third National Communication released in 2017. For some sectors, the BAU data is not directly provided. For those sectors, we have used the ‘Mitigation Scenario’ emissions levels and have added to them the mitigation potentials given in the Third National Communication. We have excluded BAU emissions from LULUCF.\n",
    "As the Third National Communication only provides BAU values for 2025, we have interpolated for values between 2010 and 2025. For the 2010 base year data, we take the values communicated in the Third National Communication.\n",
    "The data in the Third National Communication assumes Global Warming Potential (GWP) values for non-CO2 greenhouses gases from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR). As the CAT uses GWP values from the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), values from the Third National Communication have been converted from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor based on PRIMAP data.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "There is a high level of uncertainty regarding the emissions development in Iran. This is mostly due to uncertain economic growth projections linked to international economic sanctions. We capture this uncertainty by presenting a range for the current policy projections based on historical trends for agriculture and waste emissions, and GDP elasticity for energy and industry.\n",
    "Iran’s economic situation is expected to have bigger impact on the industry and the energy sector, which is why we apply GDP elasticity combined with historical GDP data with a forecast to obtain a range. Emissions from the energy and industry sector are most susceptible to fluctuations in GDP growth. For the agriculture and waste sector, which are traditionally less impacted by the economic sanctions and overall economic landscape, we just apply 5-year historical trend from 2017-2021.\n",
    "For the emissions in the agriculture and waste sector, we apply a five-year trend based on historical data for 2017-2021. For the energy and industry sector emissions, the projections are based on the historical trends of GDP elasticity of the sectors’ GHG emissions combined with GDP growth estimates from IMF (IMF, 2023) .\n",

    "\n## Global Warming Potentials Values\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR). Iran’s Third National Communication, from which much of our data is derived, uses SAR GWP values. Values from the Third National Communication have been converted from SAR to AR4 using a conversion factor based on PRIMAP data.\n",

    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "As of October 2023, Iran has signed but still has not ratified the Paris Agreement, meaning its climate pledge remains ‘intended’. In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) released in 2015, Iran pledges to reduce emissions by 4% (unconditional reduction) or 12% (conditional reduction) below business as usual (BAU) by 2030. Based on our calculations, this would translate to an unconditional reduction of 81 MtCO2e and a conditional reduction of around 240 MtCO2e compared to BAU in 2030. The INDC does not provide a BAU which makes it very difficult to assess. In the absence of a clear reference, we use the 2025 BAU provided in the Third National Communication. Values between 2026–2030 are calculated with a five-year trend from emissions growth in 2021–2025.\n",
    "The INDC mentions various unquantified measures to reach the unconditional pledge, including the development of combined cycle power plants, renewable and nuclear energy, as well as a reduction in gas flaring and energy efficiency measures in end-use sectors.\n",
    "With international support in the form of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, the target could be increased to 12% of emissions reductions below BAU by 2030. However, the INDC states that both the conditional and unconditional pledges are subject to an absence of international sanctions.\n",
    "All greenhouse gases are covered under the INDC, and it seems the target is economy-wide, including emissions from LULUCF, although this is not explicitly specified.\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "At the time of this assessment, Iran has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement.\n",

    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s conditional target as “Critically Insufficient” against modelled domestic pathways**. Iran’s conditional target pledges an emissions reduction of 12% below business as usual, which would lead to emissions increasing by around 125% compared to 2010 levels.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "**The CAT rates Iran’s unconditional target as “Critically Insufficient” against its fair share range.** Iran’s unconditional target pledges an emissions reduction of 4% below business as usual in 2030. The CAT estimates this would lead to emissions increasing by around 145% above 2010 levels.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating signals minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. Iran’s unconditional target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the 1.5°C limit. If all countries were to follow Iran’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "As of October 2023, Iran does not have a net zero target, nor has it submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC.\n",
