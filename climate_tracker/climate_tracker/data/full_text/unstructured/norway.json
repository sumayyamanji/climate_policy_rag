    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**In its latest NDC updated in November 2022, Norway slightly strengthened its 2030 emissions target to a reduction of at least 55% below 1990 levels, which we rate as “1.5°C global least cost” compared against modelled domestic pathways as being the minimum level of mitigation Norway should achieve within its borders. Considerably stronger policies will be needed to meet this target. A significant boost to committed climate finance for developing nations is a welcome outcome, but Norway’s climate finance is still “Insufficient\". There is also much still to do domestically to ensure Norway is aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal. Current policies and action are rated as “Almost sufficient”, while its NDC target against fair share and net zero targets are rated as still “Insufficient. The exported emissions from Norwegian oil and gas are not considered in the CAT’s overall “Almost sufficient” rating.**\n",
    "**Norway continues to support an expansion of oil and gas exploration in its already large fossil fuel sector. Norway’s exported fossil fuels are a large source of global emissions when their eventual combustion is taken into account. The government is seeking to throw out a case currently before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that charges that approval of new permits to drill for oil and gas would constitute a breach of fundamental human rights.**\n",
    "**Norway leads the world on electric vehicle (EV) adoption thanks to a long track record of government support and regulation. It is on track to achieve its 2025 phase out of fossil fuel vehicle sales well ahead of schedule, with the market sales share of zero emission vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles combined** **reaching 86% in February 2022****, and on track to reach 100% by the end of 2022. Reducing Norwegian transport sector emissions is a top priority given the power sector is already mostly decarbonised. This also means the electrification of transport in Norway leads to a disproportionately large reduction in emissions relative to other countries that burn fossil fuel to generate electricity.**\n",
    "The CAT rates Norway’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Almost sufficient”. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that some elements of Norway’s efforts are world leading, like its updated 2030 emissions reduction target, but its climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Norway’s updated at least 55% NDC reduction target aligns with least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C. To achieve its updated NDC target, Norway will need to enhance its current policies which are currently “Almost sufficient” and in line with 2°C warming. We also rate Norway’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share contribution to climate action. Norway should provide additional, predictable, finance to developing countries to meet its fair share contribution. Norway’s rating does not consider exported emissions from its large oil and gas production sector.\n",
    "The CAT rates Norway’s policies and action as “Almost sufficient”.\n",
    "The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "Current policies are projected to lead to emission levels of 41MtCO2e by 2030, which is 21% below emissions in 1990. Norway will need to adopt further policies in order to meet its recently strengthened NDC target.\n",
    "Norway’s electricity generation is almost exclusively renewable: in 2020, 90% of electricity was generated by hydro power plants and 2.6% from wind farms. Less than 2% of generation was from thermal power plants, mostly in industrial heat processes. As a result of its prominent hydropower supply, Norway can play a key role in balancing the electricity grids of neighbouring countries, depending on the weather in a given year.\n",
    "Norway is home to the biggest hydrocarbon reserves in Europe, making it the world’s fifth largest exporter of crude oil, and its offshore drilling activities have been subject to a carbon tax since 1991. In 1999, the carbon tax was increased, and in 2005 Norway joined the EU ETS.\n",
    "By 2018, around 80% of greenhouse gas emissions were taxed, with the highest tax charged on domestic aviation and mineral oil. Through higher taxes, investments in carbon capture and storage (CCS) have been viable since 1996, after which nearly 1 MtCO2e a year has been captured from the Sleipner Vest oilfield. In January 2021, the Norwegian government announced plans to gradually raise its carbon tax until it reaches NOK 2,000 (USD 220) by 2030. Despite Norway successfully utilising this technology on a number of its oilfields, it remains prohibitively expensive and has rarely been deployed successfully elsewhere, with the future of this technology remaining uncertain.\n",
    "Despite Norway’s relatively high carbon tax, its oil and gas sector continues to be a large emissions source, making up over a quarter of total emissions in 2020. The vast majority of emissions resulting from this sector are from combustion abroad. While this enormous source of emissions is not counted under Norway’s emissions inventory, it far outweighs total domestic emissions and represents a blight on Norway’s climate record. The current government has refused to consider a phase-out of this sector, confirming its commitment to allowing an expansion of drilling and exploration in the Barents Sea, though this decision is currently being challenged in the European Court of Human Rights.\n",
    "While the decarbonisation of Norway’s transport system is one of the three main goals of its National Transport Plan 2022–2033, almost half of the NOK 1,200 billion (USD 132bn) allocated to measures covering the period of the plan still flowed into the construction and improvement of roads and highways. Relatively high road infrastructure investments like this are, to an extent, a byproduct of Norway’s low population density. However, there is a stated commitment to increase government spending on key public transport projects in the four largest urban areas and reduce ticket prices in the main cities.\n",
    "In 2021, battery electric vehicles (BEV) sales alone reached a 65% market share, equal to 110,000 vehicles. BEVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) combined reached an 86% share of new sales, far ahead of any other country in the world, and on track to reach 100% by the end of 2022. The increasing share of electric cars in new sales has also had an impact on the overall share of zero emissions vehicles: by the end of 2020, 16% of Norway’s car fleet was fully battery electric, with a further 6% PHEVs.\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Norway amended its Petroleum Taxation Act to temporarily allow oil and gas companies to deduct investments from the tax base. Companies were also able claim the tax value of losses incurred in 2020 and 2021 from the state.\n",
    "The full policy and action analysis is available here.\n",
    "In November 2022, Norway formally updated its NDC, committing to strengthening its 2030 NDC target to at least a 55% reduction below 1990 levels. We rate this strengthened target as compatible with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C on a globally cost-effective basis.\n",
    "We rate Norway’s NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Norway’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. Given that Norway’s NDC target is 1.5°C compatible when compared to least cost modelled domestic pathways, these improvements should come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance and technical support. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "Norway’s international public finance contributions are rated “Insufficient”. The country is the only one to meet our benchmark for current contributions based on the USD 100 billion commitment and is committed to increase its finance in the period post-2020. However, its recent contributions are, on average, lower than they were in the lead up to the Paris Agreement. If Norway were to deliver the proposed increase, it would be rated “Almost sufficient”.\n",
    "Norway’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating, and the CAT rates Norway’s overall fair share contribution as \"Insufficient\".\n",
    "Norway has a substantial carbon sink in its forests - equal to around half of Norway’s annual emissions. Forest cover has been increasing. The volume of growing wood stock increased between 2011–2020 by over 12%. According to the national forestry accounting plan, Norway’s average annual removal from this sector will amount to slightly over 24 MtCO2e between 2021-2025.\n",
    "Norway has committed to a 90-95% GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 and included this target in their long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021 and restated in Norway’s 2022 updated NDC. While the target generally covers the key elements, it should be noted that Norway has not yet committed to an actual net zero target. Despite not being a net zero target, if we were to rate its 2050 target using the same rating methodology, it would be rated as ‘Average’.\n",
    "The full target analysis is available here.\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "NOTE: Norway’s 2050 target is not a net zero target, rather it targets a 90–95% reduction below 1990 levels. In the absence of a net zero target, the CAT assesses Norway’s 2050 target.\n",
    "We evaluate Norway’s 2050 target as: **Average**.\n",
    "Norway has committed to a 90–95% GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 and included this target in their long-term strategy (LTS) submitted to the UNFCCC. While the target generally covers the key elements, it should be noted that Norway has not yet committed to a net zero target.\n",
    "Norway’s continued oil and gas exploration and production poses a potential risk to global efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 given the large-scale exporting of downstream emissions that it entails. Meanwhile, its own 2050 target does not include a commitment to ramp down the oil and gas industry that constitutes a large proportion of Norway’s export economy.\n",
    "Norway’s target covers all sectors and gases although international aviation and shipping remain outside of the target’s scope. It also commits to including emission reductions achieved by Norwegian companies in the EU through the EU ETS. A periodic reviewing process of measures and interim targets is in place, even as it remains not legally binding.\n",
    "The Norwegian government currently fails to provide explicit and transparent assumptions on several key elements. While no mention of international credits was made regarding the 2050 target, offsets played a major role in previous Norwegian climate ambition. Norway also fails to communicate transparent assumptions on carbon storage and removal, nor does it provide separate reduction and removal targets.\n",
    "\n## CAT analysis of 2050 target\n",
    "* 2050 target is not a net zero target, rather it targets a 90–95% reduction below 1990 levels. In the absence of a net zero target, the CAT assesses Norway’s 2050 target.\n",
    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Norway aims to reach a GHG emissions reduction of 90–95% by 2050, but has so far not set a year to reach net zero emissions.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers). At the same time, the target only concerns an emissions reduction of 90–95% from 1990 levels.",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – Norway provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Norway states that emissions reductions achieved in the EU by Norwegian companies via Norway’s participation in the EU emissions trading system are to be included in an assessment of progress towards achieving Norway’s 2050 target.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – The Norwegian Parliament passed the Norwegian Climate Act on June 16, 2017, enshrining a GHG emissions reduction target of 80–95% by 2050 (from 1990 levels) (Climate Change Act - Act Relating to Norway’s Climate Targets, 2017). A government declaration on January 17, 2019, raised this ambition to 90–95% by 2050 (Government of Norway, 2019b). The target of 90–95% emissions reductions is included in Norway’s LTS, and was formally adopted with an amendment to Norway’s Climate Change Act in 2021 (Government of Norway, 2020a; Act Relating to Norway’s Climate Targets (Climate Change Act), 2021).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Norway provides no information on its intention to communicate separate emission reduction and removal targets.",
    "- **Review process** – Norway’s amended Climate Change Act includes a commitment to submit updated climate targets every fifth year that shall:Be based on the best available scientific knowledge; andAs far as possible, be quantitative and measurableThe Act states that these targets should represent a progression from the preceding targets and promote a gradual transformation in the period up to 2050 (Act Relating to Norway’s Climate Targets (Climate Change Act), 2021).The Act states that these targets should represent a progression from the preceding targets and promote a gradual transformation in the period up to 2050 (Act Relating to Norway’s Climate Targets (Climate Change Act), 2021).",

    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – As part of its LTS, Norway outlines its intention to use carbon dioxide removals from the forestry sector to balance residual emissions, but does not specify to what extent these will be relied upon to meet its emissions reduction targets.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – The Norwegian Climate Act established an interim target of a 40% emissions reduction by 2030 (from 1990 levels), which was subsequently raised to at least a 55% reduction by the incoming new government in 2021. To achieve its 2050 target, Norway presented a white paper outlining comprehensive climate action (Government of Norway, 2021d). Measures include, but are not restricted to, a gradual carbon tax rate increase, biofuel obligations from 2022, vehicle taxes, requirements for zero-emission solutions for passenger cars in 2022 and buses from 2025, as well as increased financial support for innovation and development.",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Norway makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target nor does it explain how they will address the gap between their realistic net zero target and what would be a fair target.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target\n",
    "Norway has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "The CAT rates Norway’s policies and action as “Almost sufficient”.\n",
    "The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C but could be, with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming could be held at—but not well below—2°C.\n",
    "Current policies are projected to lead to emission levels of 41 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which is 21% below emissions in 1990. Norway will need to adopt further policies in order to meet its updated NDC target of at least 55% emissions reductions below emissions in 1990.\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Since 1990, GHG emissions in Norway have decreased only slightly reaching 49 MtCO2e in 2020 (excluding LULUCF). Under current policy projections, Norway will be far off its 2030 target, as GHG emissions are projected to reach 41 MtCO2e by 2030 or around 21% below 1990 levels. This illustrates the need for further policies and measures to reduce emissions.\n",
    "A key plank of Norway’s recently updated 2021 Climate Action Plan is the gradual raising of its carbon tax to reach NOK 2,000, or USD 220 per tonne of CO2 by 2030 (Government of Norway, 2021c). However, it is not shown how the measures outlined in the plan will enable the achievement of Norway’s climate targets, as there is no quantification of the impact of such policies. Such a quantification will be included in Norway’s upcoming fifth biennial report to the UNFCCC and eighth national communication, both due by the end of 2022. There is no review mechanism outlined that would calculate the impact of the Norway’s carbon tax price or prospective increases, something that is critical to ensure the price is at the level necessary to achieve the stated emissions reduction targets.\n",
    "A share of the country’s reduction requirements could rely on international climate action and purchase of emissions quotas under the European regulatory framework. Such investments and purchases abroad are grounded on the cost-efficiency argument, considering that reductions in other countries are, overall, cheaper than more aggressive national policies.\n",
    "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Norwegian government presented an economic recovery package of USD 2.8 billion (NOK 27 billion). Only a small share (NOK 3.6 billion), however, was reserved for green measures (Sfrintzeris et al., 2020). At the same time, the oil and gas industry and the aviation sector received substantial support. This included an amendment of the Petroleum Taxation Act to temporarily allow oil and gas companies to deduct investments from the tax base. Companies may also claim the tax value of losses incurred in 2020 and 2021 from the State (Lovvedtak 135 (2019–2020): Vedtak Ti l Lov Om Endring i Lov Om Skattlegging Av Undersjøiske Petroleumsforekomster Mv. (Petroleumsskatteloven), 2020). Economists advised against this measure, warning it would likely lead to prolonged oil extraction at a time when the country should move away from fossil fuels (Bjørnestad, 2020; Losnegård et al., 2020). The Norwegian government also supports the aviation industry including with state-guaranteed loans for Norwegian Air, SAS Wideroe (Dunn, 2020).\n",
    "Norway’s oil and gas sector continues to be a large emissions source, making up over a quarter of total emissions in 2020 (Statistics Norway, 2022b). Given its large exports, it is also a large source of emissions in countries consuming its fossil fuel products (Scope 3 emissions). The newly elected government has refused to consider a phase-out of this sector, confirming its commitment to allowing an expansion of drilling and exploration in the Barents Sea, though this decision is currently being challenged in the European Court of Human Rights (Schwartzkopff, 2022).\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Methane pledge:** Norway signed the methane pledge at COP26, which is significant given its large oil and gas sector, and the considerable methane emissions it generates. A commitment to target a reduction in methane emissions has not, however, been included in Norway’s NDC, despite making up a tenth of Norway’s total GHG emissions in 2020 (Government of Norway, 2022).A 30% reduction in methane emissions below 2020 levels would represent a decline of 1.5 MtCO2e. A regulation prohibiting the depositing of biological waste into landfills and a 2002 directive mandating the extraction of methane emissions from landfills with biodegradable waste have led to a 53% reduction in landfill methane emissions between 1990 and 2020 (Government of Norway, 2022; Norwegian Environmental Agency, 2020).There have been no recent policy developments to target further reductions in other sectors.At COP27, Norway announced along with the US, EU and other countries the Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and Exporters on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuels, which reinforces the Global Methane Pledge. The joint declaration outlines the intention to adopt further policies and measure to reduce methane emissions along the supply chain of fossil fuel trade.",
    "- **Coal exit:** Norway has not adopted the coal exit agreement from COP26. Given Norway’s very high proportion of renewable power generation, there is negligible combustion in Norway, so the ramifications for not adopting the agreement are limited. Consequently, there is no mention of coal phase-out nor a targeting of coal-related emissions in Norway’s NDC.",
    "- **100% EVs:** Norway adopted the EV pledge at COP26. Norway leads the world on EV adoption, with its 2025 phase-out of fossil fuel vehicle sales far ahead of the COP26 pledge of 2035, and its very high proportion of EV sales, reaching 86% in February 2022. Norway’s target of 100% new EV car sales by 2025 is outlined in Norway’s National Transport Plan 2018-2029 but not in its updated NDC. Norway is currently on track to achieve its 2025 target due to a slew of policies implemented over many years including several still currently in place (see Transport section below).",
    "- **Forestry:** Norway signed the forestry pledge at COP26. Its most recent NDC includes a reference to legislation covering the period 2021-2030 that commits Norway to ensuring emissions do not exceed removals in the LULUCF sector. Specific measures are also outlined in Norway’s most recent Climate Action plan (see Forestry section below).",
    "- **Beyond Oil & Gas:** Norway has not joined the ‘Beyond Oil & Gas’ initiative to end oil and gas exploration and production. On the contrary, it is currently planning to increase both oil and gas production.",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "Electricity generation in Norway is almost exclusively renewable. In 2020, 90% of electricity was generated by hydro power plants - Norway has over 1000 storage reservoirs that correspond to 70% of annual Norwegian electricity consumption (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2022). Depending on the weather in a given year, Norway can be either a net importer or exporter of power, and when exporting a considerable supply of power, this contributes to lower the overall carbon intensity of neighbouring countries’ electricity consumption. This zero-carbon power is also often used on an hourly or daily basis to help balance the grids of neighbouring countries.\n",
    "A further 8.5% of electricity generation was from wind farms; the combined renewables share of over 98% can be seen in the figure below. Less than 2% of generation came from thermal power plants, mostly from industrial installations. As a result, the emissions intensity of Norwegian electricity is very low – around 19 gCO2/kWh in 2019, in comparison to over 300 gCO2/kWh for the EU (European Environment Agency, 2021).\n",
    "\n### Share of renewable electricity generation\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "Emissions from the industry sector play a much more important role in Norway than in many other countries as a result of Norway’s large oil and gas extraction sector. Norway is home to the biggest hydrocarbon reserves in Europe, making it the fifth largest exporter of crude oil in the world. In 2021, the oil and gas sector constituted around 60% of Norway’s exports (Statistics Norway, 2022c). Such a heavy reliance fossil fuel exports places Norway’s economy at risk given the 1.5°C temperature goal and is a strong impetus to diversify away from oil and gas production. In 2020, oil and gas extraction contributed 27% of the country’s emissions (Statistics Norway, 2022b). Norway now produces more oil and gas than the EU27 and the UK combined, as shown in the Figure below.\n",
    "\n### Oil and gas production\n",
    "Historically, Norway’s most important instrument to tackle GHG emissions has been the carbon tax on petroleum activities levied on offshore drilling since 1991. In 1999, under the White Paper on energy policy, the government adopted additional energy and CO2 taxes. The taxation level is not the same for all sectors, with higher rates for oil extraction-related activities. Overall, around 80% of GHG emissions are taxed and/or regulated through the EU ETS, with most industries currently taxed at around NOK 590 or USD 59.6 (Buli & Adomaitis, 2021).\n",
    "The emission intensity of Norwegian oil and gas extraction is, at 55 kgCO2 per tonne oil equivalent (toe), significantly lower than the world average of 130 kgCO2 (Gavenas et al., 2015). The Norwegian carbon tax, which was introduced in 1991, is one of the factors that explains its relatively low emissions intensity (Gavenas et al., 2015). This is due in part to the fact that it has helped to make carbon, capture and storage (CCS) viable on its oil and gas fields, with almost 1 MtCO2/yr being captured and stored since 1996 (Norwegian Petroleum, 2020). In 2015, Norway was ranked sixth out of 50 countries in terms of the lowest emissions intensity of crude oil extraction (Masnadi et al., 2018). Its performance in this regard compared to nearby Russia is shown in the Figure below. In April 2019, the leader of the opposition Labour Party called for setting a deadline for oil extraction to become fully emissions free (Holter, 2019).\n",
    "\n### Oil and Gas emissions intensity\n",
    "In 2021, Norway’s state-owned coal company announced it will close its last mine in the Arctic area of Svalbard in 2023 (Reuters, 2021). The mine currently supplies a local coal power plant, one of very few remaining in Norway, that will be closed in 2023, with the main Svalbard settlement switching to diesel fuel temporarily before transitioning fully to renewable energy.\n",
    "In a minor sign of progress, the Norwegian government agreed not to grant any oil and gas exploration licenses for virgin or little-explored areas in 2022 (The Local, 2021). This does not exclude new licenses to be granted for areas that have already been heavily exploited, with new licenses for such areas offered in March 2022 (Reuters, 2022).\n",
    "This comes on the heels of a decision by the European Court of Human Rights to take up a case that is challenging Norway’s plans for new oil and gas drilling in the Barents Sea (Schwartzkopff, 2022). The case charges that approval of such permits would constitute a breach of fundamental human rights. In April 2022, the Norwegian government requested the case be found inadmissible, with that decision still pending as of June 2022 . The court noted that this case may potentially be designated an “impact” case, which could provide a new route for holding governments accountable for similar actions.\n",
    "In the decade to 2022, the Norwegian government awarded more than 700 oil and gas exploration licenses, more than in the previous 47 years (Oil Change International, 2022). These licenses represent 2.8 billion barrels of new oil and gas resources, and if development of oilfields already licensed but not producing is permitted, this could lead to an additional 3 GtCO2 of emissions abroad if these fuels are sold and consumed.\n",
    "The Norwegian Government supported investment in carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by setting aside NOK 80 million (USD 9.6 million) in 2018 to fund Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) studies (Ministry of Petroleum and Energy., 2018). In January 2019, Norway’s Ministry of Oil granted a license to the country’s major, state-owned, energy company, Equinor (formerly Statoil) to develop carbon storage, aiming to receive around 1.5 MtCO2 annually from onshore installations (Reuters, 2019). In September 2019, Equinor signed preliminary agreements with potential customers, including cement and steel companies, to develop a subsea storage for up to 5 MtCO2 in the framework of the Northern Lights project (Adomaitis, 2019). Equinor is currently also investigating whether CO2 from a cement factory Brevik and/or a waste incineration plant in Oslo can be stored in a reservoir in the North Sea (Government of Norway, 2020b).\n",
    "Norway’s government-owned climate investment body Enova announced an investment of EUR 100m in clean hydrogen production for three separate industrial projects, but just under three quarters of this funding will go towards producing ‘blue hydrogen’ from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (Bellona, 2021). The remaining EUR 27m will go towards producing renewable hydrogen. Funding blue hydrogen to such an extent is questionable given it still produces emissions and the vast renewable resources available to Norway for producing renewable hydrogen. In March 2022, Norway and Germany agreed to conduct a joint review to investigate the potential for large-scale transportation of hydrogen from Norway to Germany. A joint statement indicated that the intention is to utilise blue hydrogen for a transition period, with the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck indicating his preference for receiving ‘green’ hydrogen produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy.\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "The decarbonisation of Norway’s transport system is one of the three main goals of its National Transport Plan (NTP) 2022–2033 (Government of Norway, 2021a). This plan includes a target to reduce transport emissions by 50% below 2005 levels by 2030 (36% below 1990 levels). Since the power sector is largely decarbonised, Norway has been focusing on reducing emissions in the transport sector to help achieve emission reduction rates similar to the EU (with whom they share the same reduction target).\n",
    "Emissions from road transport decreased by almost a fifth between 2015 and 2020 (from 10.1 MtCO2 in 2015 to 8.2 MtCO2 in 2019) (Government of Norway, 2022). Indeed, the transport sector has shown the largest drop in emissions in recent years, an outlier relative to many other countries where transport emissions have either been stagnant or rising.\n",
    "The Government allocated NOK 1,076 (USD 118) billion to realise initiatives in the NTP, including (Royal Ministry of Finance, 2019) expansion of the rail network and improving existing services, but almost half of this funding is allocated to roadworks, something that is primarily a by-product of Norway’s low population density.\n",
    "The rapid increase in sales of electric vehicles in Norway is unmatched anywhere in the world. In 2021, zero emission passenger vehicles reached a 65% market share, compared to 54% in 2020, and 42% in 2019 (Klesty, 2022). The market share of zero emission vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles combined reached 86% in February 2022, placing Norway on track to reach 100% as early as the end of the year (Holland, 2022). Of the total passenger car fleet in Norway, 16% were fully electric by the end of 2020, with a further 6% hybrid electric (Ferris, 2022).\n",
    "\n### Historical, current and expected future battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles market share in Norway, the EU and the US\n",
    "The increasing share of electric vehicles has had an impact on the average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars, reaching just 60 gCO2/km in 2019, less than half the 2019 EU average of 122 gCO2/km (EEA, 2021; OFV, 2020). The electrification of transport has also had an impact on overall emissions from this sector: after a continuous increase between 1990 and 2014, emissions from passenger vehicles declined by roughly a quarter between 2015 and 2020 (Statistics Norway, 2021b). Primarily as a result of the increased market share of electric vehicles, total sales of diesel and petrol have fallen for three years in a row by 336 million litres in total over this time. This is a larger decrease than the overall decline from the 1974 oil crisis, after the 1987 stock market crash and after the 2008 financial crisis (Norsk elbilforening, 2020).\n",
    "Norway has established a number of electric vehicle incentives, including an exemption from 25% VAT on purchases, access to bus lanes, and a maximum charge of 50% of the full price for parking and ferry fees, which have been extended to the end of 2022 (Norsk elbilforening, 2021). With its legislation, Norway has targeted all new passenger cars and light vans to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2025, and that new city buses will be zero-emissions or run on biogas by the same target year (Government of Norway, 2021a). At the end of 2021, there was just 251 electric buses in Norway compared to over 2,400 diesel and gas buses (Statistics Norway, 2022a).\n",
    "Electrification is also planned for railways, substituting old diesel-fuelled lines to achieve emission reductions, but also higher train speeds and cost competitiveness against road transport, given the country’s low electricity costs. By 2030, all heavier vans, 75% of new long-distance buses, and 50% of all new lorries should be zero-emission vehicles.\n",
    "Norway is also a pioneer in electric ferries. The Norwegian parliament has passed a resolution which calls on the government to transform its fjords into a zero-emissions control area by 2026 (Brown, 2018). The world’s largest electric ferry launched in March 2021 which will transport passengers between the two cities of Moss and Horten, Norway’s busiest ferry route (Daily Scandinavian, 2021). Norway’s first electric ferry was brought into service in 2015. Avinor, which operates most civil airports in Norway and is fully owned by the state, aims to electrify all domestic aviation by 2040 (Avinor, 2018).\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "Norway has tightened building regulations over the last two decades, resulting in direct emissions from the buildings sector decreasing by more than three quarters between 1990 and 2019 (Climate Analytics, 2022). In November 2015, new Building Codes called TEK17 were adopted, introducing stricter limits for different categories of new and refurbished builds that became binding for all homeowners in 2017: 100 kWh/m2 for single houses, 95 kWh/m2 for apartments and 115 kWh/m2 for offices (Buildup, 2015; Direkoratet for Byggkvalitet, 2017; Faschevsky, 2016).\n",
    "Under the EU’s Energy Performance of Buildings directive, all new buildings should be near-zero energy buildings (NZEBs) by the end of 2020. This target was agreed upon by the Norwegian parliament in 2012, however, since then, a national definition of NZEBs has not been finalised, meaning that the target cannot yet be fulfilled (Brekke et al., 2020). The above numbers are not, however, in line with this target.\n",
    "Homeowners are also encouraged to increase the share of renewables produced domestically. Should an equivalent of more than 20 kWh/m2 be produced on the property, the respective limit on energy consumption can be exceeded by 10 kWh/m2 (Buildup, 2015). The production of renewable energy should not justify an increase in gross energy consumption, as this will still lead to increasing emissions if fossil heating is in use.\n",
    "Norway has also introduced a ban on fossil fuel (oil and paraffin, given the unavailability of natural gas) heating systems. This ban has been phased in since 2016 and has been in full force from 2020 onwards. The ban applies to both new buildings and renovations and both private homes and public spaces of businesses and state-owned facilities (Reuters, 2017). According to Norway’s Seventh National Communication this ban will reduce emissions in the country by 400 ktCO2 in comparison to business-as-usual (Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, 2018a).\n",
    "Norway has a substantial carbon sink in its forests which equals approximately half of Norway’s annual emissions. Since 2005 the forest area in this country has been increasing and in 2020 reached 33.4% of the land surface – around 0.2% more than a decade earlier (World Bank, 2021). The volume of growing wood stock increased between 2011-2020 by 12.5% (SSB, 2021).\n",
    "According to its national forestry accounting plan, between 2021-2025 Norway’s average removals from this sector will amount to slightly over 24 MtCO2e (Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment., 2019). As part of its recently updated Climate Action Plan, Norway has committed to introduce a minimum logging age in its Forestry Act in line with the PEFC Forest Standard, and to facilitate afforestation of new land, though no quantitative targets were set (Government of Norway, 2021c). In November 2021, Norway signed the forestry pledge at COP26 that committed to halting and reversing forest loss and degradation by 2030 (UK Government/UNFCCC, 2021). Given Norway’s forestry sector is already an increasingly large emissions sink, this is not particularly ambitious.\n",
    "In addition, Norway has pledged up to NOK 3 billion (USD 343 million) a year in the framework of the Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) to reduce deforestation in other countries (Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, 2018b).\n",
    "\n## Finance\n",
    "In March 2019, Norway’s government decided to follow on the advice of Norwegian Central Bank and phase-out investment of its Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), worth around USD 1.35tn, in companies dealing with oil and gas exploration and production (Royal Ministry of Finance, 2018). This will result in gradually selling shares of 134 companies worth USD 8bn, increasing supply and consequently reducing share prices (New Scientist, 2019). Divestment announcements can also affect investor sentiment, potentially also negatively impacting prices and reducing firm profitability. While a belated step in the right direction, this decision will still allow the GPFG to invest in companies providing oil and gas services, such as BP or Shell, which currently constitute a significant share of the Fund’s investment amounting to USD 2.9bn and USD 5.9bn respectively (Norges Bank, 2019a). These efforts are part of a broader divestment campaign that has led to over USD 40tn in pledged divestment from fossil fuel companies (Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Commitments Database, 2022).\n",
    "Following a proposal by a government-appointed commission in mid-2021 that the GPFG should push firms that it invests in to cut their GHG emissions to zero by 2050, the fund outlined its intention to be an “active shareholder” and push firms to make the transition to net zero emissions (Norges Bank, 2021). The GPFG specified that it would not divest from such companies that are major emitters of GHG emissions.\n",
    "In June 2019, Norway’s Parliament voted to divest from eight coal companies and around 150 oil producers (Ambrose, 2019). As a result, stocks worth more than USD 10 billion will be divested. The Fund is no longer able to invest in any company generating more than 10 GW of electricity from coal or mining more than 20 million tonnes of coal annually (Nikel, 2019). This should be reduced to zero to send a stronger signal to companies that they must phase out coal as soon as possible.\n",
    "In May 2020, Norges Bank – the Norwegian Central Bank – which manages the state-owned oil fund divested from five companies for their coal activities (Norges Bank, 2020). The fund was a major shareholder in all companies and its decision to divest sends a strong signal and may be followed by others (Milne, 2020).\n",
    "Since 2019, the Oil Fund can invest in renewable energy projects that are not listed at the stock exchange (Ministry of Finance., 2019) and which represent 71% of the investable market (McKinsey&Company, 2018). Since these projects come at a higher risks, the Government has introduced a cap on investments in unlisted renewable energy projects at 2% of the Fund, amounting to around USD 20 billion (Ministry of Finance., 2019). The 2020-2022 strategy document provides that renewable energy investment should make up 1% of the Fund towards the end of 2022 (Norges Bank, 2019b).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Greenhouse gas emission inventories for 1990–2020 are based on the National Inventory Report 2022 submitted to the UNFCCC (Government of Norway, 2022).\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "The NDC and long-term target were calculated from the most recent national inventory submissions.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "We use the latest emissions projections under current policies submitted by Norway to the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2021 harmonised to actual 2020 emissions from Norway’s official GHG emissions inventory submitted to the UNFCCC. The 2021 EEA projections under current policies include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potential\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Following the current Norwegian Labour government pledge to strengthen Norway’s 2030 emissions reduction target in early 2022, Norway formally submitted a renewed 2030 emissions reduction target in the run up to COP27, changing from 50% to at least 55% below 1990 levels in its updated NDC. This puts it in line with the EU’s target.\n",
    "Norway intends to achieve this target in collaboration with the European Union. Norway will regulate emissions from all economic sectors through three pieces of legislation: the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) and the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. Under the EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation, which covers sectors not included in the EU ETS, Norway is only required to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030, though Norway increased this to 45%. This target is not compatible with its overall 55% target seeing as most of Norway’s emissions reductions must come from sectors not covered by the EU ETS.\n",
    "Under the LULUCF Regulation, Norway commits to no net emissions from the LULUCF sector between 2021 and 2030 (Government of Norway, 2020c). Norway is permitted to use up to 1.6 MtCO2e in net removals from the land sector towards meeting its NDC.\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "In November 2022, Norway submitted a stronger target compared to its previous 2020 NDC, Norway updated its NDC with a 2030 emissions target of at least 55% below 1990 levels. Norway’s updated target represents progress beyond its previous submission.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.**Analysis of earlier NDC developments**:\n",
    "- 2020.02.07 - Norway's updated NDC: Progress, but not Paris compatible",
    "\n## CAT Rating\n",
    "We rate NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders based on modelled domestic pathways derived from global least cost pathways as well as what a fair contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C would be. For the latter, we consider both its domestic emission reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support. Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found here.\n",
    "In its 2020 NDC, Norway had indicated that it may use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement for part of its NDC target if the EU did not also update its target to the same level (Government of Norway, 2020c). In December 2020, the EU submitted its updated NDC to at least a 55% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels. As the EU NDC matches Norway’s latest unconditional target of at least 55%, we interpret this target as being a domestic one for the time being, (i.e. with no emissions reductions achieved through international credits), although this may change in the future. In its 2022 NDC, Norway states it could use Article 6 mechanisms to meet emissions reductions going “beyond what is achieved through the climate cooperation with the European Union”.\n",
    "The CAT rates Norway's NDC target as aligned with least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C and \"Insufficient\" when rated against its fair share contribution. As Norway does not have an emissions reduction target that includes non-domestic emissions reductions, as is the case with Switzerland, for example, we rate its NDC target against the two rating frameworks.\n",
    "NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "Norway’s updated NDC broadly aligns with the least cost modelled pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C with no low overshoot. Norway has committed to strengthening its 2030 target to at least a 55% reduction below 1990 levels, which was formally communicated to the UNFCCC in 2022. This represents a reduction of emissions of 50% below 2020 levels, excluding LULUCF. The “1.5°C global least cost” rating indicates that Norway’s NDC target in 2030 is consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C on a globally cost-effective basis.\n",
    "NDC target against fair share\n",
    "We rate Norway’s updated NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Norway’s NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Norway’s NDC target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. However, it will not be feasible for Norway to achieve all these emissions reductions domestically. Therefore, Norway will need to develop clear and ambitious plans to support climate action in other countries, particularly through capacity building, technology transfer and climate finance. If all countries were to follow Norway’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "Norway’s international climate finance contributions are rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve its fair share rating.\n",
    "Norway’s international public finance contributions are rated “Insufficient”. The country is the only one to meet our benchmark for current contributions based on the USD 100 billion commitment and is committed to doubling its climate finance from NOK 7bn (USD 770m) in 2020 to NOK 14bn (USD 1.54bn) by 2026 at the latest (Government of Norway, 2021b). Despite this pledged increase, current contributions are yet to reach levels sufficient to be considered aligned with the least cost modelled domestic pathways which limit warming to 1.5°C with no low overshoot\n",
    "Norway’s international contributions are the highest among CAT countries considering its mitigation obligation. Norway also ranks first in finance provided per capita and per GDP. Some of the country’s main initiatives are the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) and contributions to multilateral institutions and funds, such as the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF). A high share of Norway’s contributions has climate as a main objective and is based on grants.\n",
    "Overall, yearly contributions slightly decreased from before Paris until 2019, but 2020 saw a sizeable increase year-on-year. The Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative, the country’s largest program, has been extended to 2030. Norway also announced an increase in contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other multi-lateral channels (Government of Norway, 2019a).\n",
    "Norway has not committed to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and continues to allow new domestic oil and gas exploration. Norway’s parliament voted in 2019 to divest part of its sovereign-wealth fund investments on fossil fuels; however, investment in major oil companies remains. In 2021, it was announced that Norway will offer financial institution support in measuring and assessing climate risks in their investment portfolios (Schwartzkopff, 2021).\n",
    "Further information on the CAT climate finance ratings can be found here.\n",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term targets\n",
    "Norway has committed to a 90–95% GHG emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2050 and included this target in their long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC (Norwegian Government, 2020).\n",
    "\n## 2020 pledge\n",
    "**Copenhagen Pledge**\n",
    "Under the Copenhagen Accord, Norway has pledged to reduce emissions by 30–40% below 1990 levels by 2020 with the 40% reduction target conditional on global action.\n",
    "Norway did not achieve its 2020 target, even with the effect that the pandemic had on emissions in 2020. Norway’s target level was 36-31 MtCO2e (excluding the land sector contribution). Its emissions in 2020 were 49.3 MtCO2e (excl. LULUCF), which are only 4% below 1990 levels (Government of Norway, 2022a).\n",
