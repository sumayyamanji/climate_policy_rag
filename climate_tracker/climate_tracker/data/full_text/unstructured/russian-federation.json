    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has highlighted the need for the world to reduce demand for fossil fuels (fossil gas, oil, and coal) as the right response to both climate and energy crises. The full implications of the energy crisis are being felt globally, and the extent of their impact is uncertain.**\n",
    "**Russia’s efforts to tackle climate change remain very low. Its few relevant policies are unambitious or have an unclear expected effect on emissions. Russia’s existing policies indicate no real commitment to curb emissions. The CAT estimates that Russia can easily reach its updated NDC target from November 2020 with adopted policies and should therefore submit a stronger 2030 target.**\n",
    "**In September 2022, the Russian government provided more detail on its net zero GHG emissions target for 2060. The government assumes that by 2050 forests would take up twice as much carbon as they do today, which means that all other emissions do not really have to reach zero, but only need to be cut by in half to reach the overall net zero target. No information substantiates such an enormous increase of carbon take-up. It also doesn’t appear to address the impact of enormous wildfires in its Siberian forests in recent years.**\n",
    "**In 2021, Russia adopted its law aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions, having gutted it of all measures that would have resulted in substantive emissions reductions. The Energy Strategy to 2035, adopted in 2021, focuses almost exclusively on promoting fossil fuel extraction, consumption, and exports to the rest of the world. Such a strong focus on increasing reliance on fossil fuel revenues poses a considerable economic risk in a future compatible with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C temperature limit.**\n",
    "**Russia’s lack of any substantial contribution to international climate finance goals, together with its highly insufficient domestic target and climate policies result in the CAT giving Russia an overall rating of “Critically Insufficient”.**\n",
    "The CAT rates Russia’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s climate policies and commitments reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "Russia failed to increase its ambition when it submitted its NDC update in November 2020. We rate the updated NDC target as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways and “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. It is also not providing adequate climate finance, which we rate as “Critically insufficient”. The weak target will be easily met under existing policies and action, which we rate as “Highly insufficient”.\n",
    "Russia needs to set a more ambitious target for emissions reductions, adopt and implement additional policies, and provide additional finance to improve its CAT rating.\n",
    "Russia’s efforts to tackle climate change are deficient. Under current policies, Russia’s economy-wide emissions are expected to continue rising to 2030, when they should be rapidly declining, especially for such a large emitter. The CAT rates Russia’s current policies as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s policies and actions are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
    "In June 2021 Russia adopted its heavily watered-down climate bill that, unlike the original iteration of the legislation, does not enforce emissions quotas or impose penalties on large GHG emitters. Instead, it simply requires companies to report their emissions starting from 2024. Considerable uncertainty remains in Russia’s renewable energy sector, with no targets in place beyond its very modest renewable electricity generation target of 4.5% (excluding hydropower) by 2024 that it will not achieve. In the transport sector, Russia has taken steps to promote the production and purchase of EVs as well as reduce transport emissions.\n",
    "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "We rate Russia’s 2030 NDC target of a 30% reduction below 1990 levels by 2030 as being “Highly insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s domestic target in 2030 is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
    "We rate Russia’s 2030 NDC target of a 30% reduction below 1990 levels as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s target, when compared to what its fair share would be in 2030, reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Russia’s target is not in line with any interpretation of a fair approach to meeting the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "Russia’s international public finance contributions are rated “Critically insufficient”. Russia has not made any substantial contribution to international climate finance since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. To improve its rating, Russia needs to urgently increase its financial contributions and stop funding fossil fuels abroad.\n",
    "Russia’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve its fair share rating, and the CAT rates Russia’s overall fair share contribution as “Critically insufficient”.\n",
    "Russia’s land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector has been a large emissions sink since the mid-1990s, reaching a maximum of -720 MtCO2e in 2010 (36% of total non-LULUCF GHG emissions). This has since declined to -569 MtCO2e in 2020, the latest year of inventory data, and is expected to continue declining to 246 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies. A recent announcement by the Environment Ministry outlines Russia’s intention to include unmanaged ‘reserve’ forests alongside managed forests in accounting of net forestry emissions. This is in violation of a key element of international climate reporting, with the UN’s IPCC guidelines stating that only managed forests may be included in carbon accounting practices.\n",
    "Russian Federation approved its ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’ in October 2021 and submitted it to the UNFCCC in September 2022. The strategy outlines several measures intended to enable the achievement of its net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060 target, but they are lacking detail on how or when they will be implemented, or what their projected impact on emissions would be. The CAT evaluates the net zero target’s comprehensiveness as “Poor”.\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the target as: **Poor.**\n",
    "Russia approved its ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’ in October 2021 and submitted it to the UNFCCC on September 5, 2022 as its long-term climate strategy (LTS) (Russian Federation, 2021a, 2022c). As part of this strategy, Russia has committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060. The strategy also includes a target to reduce GHG emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050, leaning heavily on negative emissions from the LULUCF sector, which are projected to more than double between 2030 and 2050, from -539 MtCO2e to -1,200 MtCO2e.\n",
    "The Ministry of Economic Development had prepared a draft implementation “road map” for the strategy by February 2022 and planned to finalise it by March (Interfax, 2022; Russian Federation, 2022a). However, as of October 2022 the Ministry is updating the draft to account for “the changed conditions” and “increased challenges” since the implementation plan was first drafted (TASS, 2022).\n",
    "Some of the key planned measures outlined in the strategy include the creation of economic incentives to reduce GHG emissions, a systematic replacement of inefficient technologies, and creating conditions to ensure Russian companies are competitive in low-carbon markets. At present, there is little to no action being undertaken on any of these stated policy requirements. If Russia is to align itself with the goals of the Paris Agreement, as it has stated it intends to, significant action in these areas and others will be required.\n",
    "To improve its net zero target rating, the Russian government can consider good practice approaches shown further below including clarifying the reductions and removals projected for its 2060 target in addition to its 2050 target and including international shipping and aviation emissions under the target.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Russia aims to reach net zero emissions by 2060.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – Although the long-term climate strategy does not explicitly list all greenhouse gases covered, the document mentions Russia aims to balance anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by \"no later than 2060\". Based on this, we interpret the strategy to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. The target covers all sectors of the economy (excluding international aviation and shipping).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – Russia provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Russia has not provided any information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – Russia’s ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation for low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’, which contains its 2060 net zero target, was approved via government order, akin to legislation, in October 2021 (Russian Federation, 2021a). Russia submitted its Long-Term Strategy to the UNFCCC in September 2022 (Russian Federation, 2022c).",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Separate reduction and removal targets are provided for 2030 and 2050 under Russia’s long-term strategy, but not for its targeted net zero objective in 2060. Planned removals would be as high as half of current emissions of all other sectors, meaning, that these other sectors would only have to be cut in half to meet the net zero target.",
    "- **Review process** – Russia’s long-term strategy states that progress of its implementation will be monitored, and that the strategy will be updated “as necessary” (Russian Federation, 2022c). The government provides no details on what this means or what such a review would entail. It does refer to the global stocktake mandated under the Paris Agreement in 2023 as a point at which the strategy could be updated.",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Russia does not provide transparent assumptions on carbon dioxide removal. Russia’s projected negative emissions in 2050 are more than double current levels of land sinks, reaching -1,200 MtCO2e. These negative emissions are projected to be achieved from the LULUCF sector, and there is no information available in the strategy to substantiate the increase or any assumptions on technical carbon dioxide removal approaches. An increase of this magnitude should be transparently explained to justify it as part of the strategy to reach net zero. There is also no projection to 2060 to outline the level of reductions required to reach net zero emissions.Russia has announced it will update its accounting methodology for estimating emissions from the LULUCF sector, indicating it will begin counting forests currently designated as unmanaged, as managed forest, therefore including them in its GHG inventory (Light, 2021). This is in violation of a key element of international climate reporting, with the UN’s IPCC guidelines stating that only managed forests may be included in carbon accounting practices (IPCC, 2006).",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – Russia’s long-term emissions strategy outlines several planned measures, but they are lacking detail on how or when they will be implemented, or what their projected impact on emissions would be. The Ministry of Economic Development had finished preparing a draft implementation plan or “road map” in February 2022, however the ministry is now redrafting the implementation plan to take into account the current geopolitical and economic situation (Interfax, 2022; Russian Federation, 2022a; TASS, 2022).",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Russia makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target.",
    "For further information on the targets, the Russian Federation has adopted, see the targets tab.\n",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target\n",
    "Russia has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "The CAT rates Russia’s current policies as “Highly insufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s policies and action in 2030 lead to rising, rather than falling, emissions and are not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
    "We do not observe any substantial change in Russia’s efforts to tackle climate change. Its few relevant policies are unambitious or have unclear expected effect on emissions. Russia's existing policies indicate no real commitment to curb emissions.\n",
    "In June 2021, Russia adopted its heavily watered-down climate bill that, unlike the original iteration of the legislation, does not enforce emissions quotas nor impose penalties on large GHG emitters. Instead, its main provision simply requires companies to report their emissions from 2024. Considerable uncertainty remains in Russia’s renewable energy sector. Russia has no targets in place beyond its unambitious non-hydro generation target of 4.5% by 2024, which it will not meet.\n",
    "In the transport sector, Russia has taken steps to promote the production and purchase of EVs. As part of its Transport Strategy Until 2030, Russia has also proposed measures to reduce transport emissions through low-carbon infrastructure and alternative fuels.\n",
    "Though the CAT’s qualitative analysis does touch on some of the near-term implications of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, we have not quantified the long-term effect of the war, nor its numerous implications. The projections do not yet include, for example decrease in fossil fuel exports or potential economic decline in Russia.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Under current policies, Russia’s economy-wide emissions are expected to continue rising to 2030, when they should be rapidly declining. According to our latest estimates, currently implemented policies would lead to emissions between 2,285 and 2,314 MtCO2e in 2030 (excluding LULUCF). This represents a 27–28% decrease in emissions below 1990 levels, a level that is below the unambitious NDC target for 2030, which amounts to a 24% decrease below 1990 levels (excluding LULUCF).\n",
    "**Recent legislative developments**\n",
    "In August 2021, Russia approved the Concept for the Development of Electric Vehicle Production which set a target of EVs constituting at least 10% of domestically produced vehicles by 2030 (Russian Federation, 2021b). In addition to promoting EV production, Russia plans to provide subsidies covering up to 25% of the price of domestically produced EVs to stimulate demand (Reuters, 2021).\n",
    "In September 2021, Russia approved, for the first time, a law aimed at regulating emissions though it is a significantly watered-down version with very limited impact on Russia’s future emissions (The Moscow Times, 2021). Initially, this legislation aimed at limiting emissions by assigning quotas for Russia’s largest companies, a new national carbon trading system and penalties for companies who exceeded their quotas (The Moscow Times, 2019). However, due to resistance from the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, all of these measures, except for the requirement of companies to report their emissions from 2024, were removed (The Moscow Times, 2019).\n",
    "In November 2021, Russia released the Transport Strategy Until 2030. The strategy includes measures for energy-efficient or electric vehicles, low-carbon infrastructure, and alternative fuels intended to reduce transport emissions by 1.2% relative to total emissions in 2017 by 2030 (Russian Federation, 2021c) .\n",
    "The EU’s proposed Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which seeks to place a levy on carbon intensive goods, is likely to substantially affect Russian exports, with a recent study estimating Russia were to face higher costs from the proposed mechanism than any other country (Assous et al., 2021). Prior to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, the EU was Russia’s largest trading partner. It remains to be seen how Russia-EU trade flows will develop in the coming years, but without implementing substantial measures to decarbonise the Russian industry sector, the economic costs of any future trade with the EU are likely to climb over time.\n",
    "While 2021 saw some positive developments, in 2022 Russia has rolled back some environmental protection and emission reductions measures, for example, as of early May, Russian car makers no longer have to adhere to pollution control standards used by the European Union (Zelenaya, 2022).\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Methane pledge:** Russia has not adopted the methane pledge. Methane, predominately from the energy sector, constituted 15% of Russia’s total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2020. Russia does not propose quantifiable mitigation measures directed at reducing methane in its NDC.",
    "- **Coal exit:** Russia has not adopted the coal exit. Russia does not plan to phase out coal. In 2021, Russia was the third largest coal exporter (17.9 % of global exports) in the world (BP, 2022).",
    "- **100% EVs:** Russia has not adopted the declaration on accelerating the transition to 100% zero emission cars and vans from COP26. Russia has set the target of EVs constituting at least 10% of domestically produced vehicles by 2030 and plans to provide subsidies covering up to 25% of the price of domestically produced EVs in order to stimulate demand.",
    "- **Forestry:** Russia signed the Leaders' declaration on forest and land use at COP26, but this is not included in its NDC. Please see the forestry section below for more details on why Russia places significance on its LULUCF sector as a net carbon sink.",
    "- **Beyond oil and gas:** Russia is not a member of BOGA. In 2021, Russia was the world’s largest exporter of fossil gas—with 23.6% of global exports—and the second largest exporter of oil (12.3% of total) (BP, 2022).",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has generated price shocks that have reverberated through global energy markets.\n",
    "Russia’s continued reliance on fossil fuel energy and export revenues (contributing to 45% of Russia’s federal budget in 2021) poses a significant challenge to the Russian economy, now exacerbated by the sanctions placed on Russia by other governments in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It also adds to the impacts Russia faces from the changing climate (IEA, 2022b).\n",
    "In 2021, Russia was the world’s largest exporter of fossil gas—with 23.6% of global exports—and the second largest exporter of oil (12.3% of total) (BP, 2022). Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the global demand for Russian fossil fuels has declined as many governments, including the EU, have imposed economic sanctions (Myllyvirta et al., 2022).\n",
    "The EU has set a partial embargo on Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and on Russian oil products by the end of February, and it ended Russian coal imports in August (European Council, 2022a, 2022b; Myllyvirta et al., 2022). These sanctions will have a significant impact on the Russian economy as well as globally. For example, in the case of the EU, Russian fossil gas imports made up almost 40% of total EU consumption of fossil gas, Russian oil imports contributed to 25% of total EU oil imports, and 20% of the EU’s coal consumption in 2021 (BP, 2022).\n",
    "These developments, combined with the banking sector’s increasingly unwillingness to finance fossil fuel projects seen as contributing to climate change, do not bode well for Russia’s plans to expand fossil fuel exports and will have substantial negative implications for Russia’s public finances (Associated Press, 2020; Ekblom, 2019; IEA, 2022a; Russian Federation, 2020a).\n",
    "Estimating the trajectory of GHG emissions in the energy sector in the near future is difficult due to the major changes. The CAT projections therefore do not yet include, for example decrease in fossil fuel exports or potential economic decline in Russia, which would have much larger impact on emissions compared to any policies currently implemented.\n",
    "In 2020, Russia committed to reducing its energy intensity of GDP by 30% by 2030 (Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, 2020). A 30% reduction from Russia’s 2019 energy intensity of 7.6 TJ per million USD 2015 GDP would put Russia’s energy intensity at 5.3 in 2030, which is still higher than the G20 average of 4.4 in 2019 (Climate Transparency, 2021).\n",
    "With Russia’s energy sector accounting for nearly 80% of all emissions (excl. LULUCF) in 2020 (Russian Federation, 2022b), Russia should focus on further increasing its renewable energy generation to move towards a 1.5°C compatible pathway, avoid technology lock-in, and improve energy security, instead of relying on increasing its LULUCF sink to negate these emissions (see Forestry section below).\n",
    "**Energy Strategy to 2035**\n",
    "In June 2020, Russia adopted its long-delayed Energy Strategy 2035, confirming Russia’s intention to heavily support its fossil fuel energy sectors beyond the next decade (Russian Federation, 2020a). The strategy suggests that Russia will continue to sell oil, coal, and gas to the rest of the world, while everything that hinders this goal is considered to be a threat and a challenge (Zhelenin, 2020). This stands in blatant contradiction to the IEA’s recent finding that no investments in new oil and gas extraction projects should occur beyond 2021 (IEA, 2021a).\n",
    "The strategy assumes that “until 2035 fossil fuels will continue to form the basis of the global energy sector with a gradual increase in the share of energy based on the use of renewable sources” (Russian Federation, 2020a). These assumptions underpin both scenarios outlined in the document, and accordingly, there is little focus on renewable energy technologies, and no long-term targeted increase in generation from this sector.\n",
    "The intention behind Russia’s energy strategy has been signalled by recent government decisions supportive of fossil fuel companies. In 2021, Novatek, Russia’s largest independent fossil gas producer, requested access to more gas resources to support the construction of its third large-scale gas facility since 2017 (Persily, 2021).\n",
    "The gas deposits Novatek wanted access to were within the boundaries of a nature reserve where industrial activities are prohibited, but after reportedly requesting that the Kremlin instruct the regional government to adjust the boundaries to allow the facility to proceed, the regional government obliged in May 2021 and the boundaries were changed (Persily, 2021). In addition, President Putin in August 2021 ordered the introduction of amendments designed to allow Russian Railways and coal miners to agree on expanding eastward coal exports (The Coal Hub, 2021).\n",
    "Other key elements of Russia’s energy strategy include advocating for the development of clean-coal technology and for minimising the flaring of fossil gas as key measures to address climate change in the energy sector.\n",
    "**Fossil gas and flaring emissions**\n",
    "Fossil gas made up 54% of Russia’s total primary energy supply in 2020 and this is projected to remain consistent under stated policies through 2030 (IEA, 2021b). Russia’s Energy Strategy to 2035 forecasts a 5-9% growth in fuel production by 2024 compared to 2018, including at least a doubling in the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) (Russian Federation, 2020a, 2020b). This continued investment in the production of and reliance on fossil gas is problematic, as gas does not have a place in long-term 1.5°C compatible scenarios and still produces significant GHG emissions in both its production and consumption (IPCC, 2018).\n",
    "Despite a stated goal of minimising flaring and the introduction in 2012 of a 5% limit on flaring of gas as a proportion of total production, Russia still struggles to contain gas flaring (Korppoo, 2018; Russian Federation, 2009). In 2015, Russia reached the lowest level of flaring at around 12%, but since then flaring has been increasing and reached 17.4% in 2020 (Reuters Staff, 2021).\n",
    "Russia’s Energy Strategy to 2035 introduced an even less ambitious target of 10% by 2024 and 5% by 2035 (IEA, 2022a; Russian Federation, 2020a). This target is not quantified because Russia does not appear to be taking steps toward achieving it. In 2021, Russia maintained its position as the world’s largest gas flaring nation by volume (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), 2022). At 25 billion cubic metres, Russia flared about 30% more gas in 2021 than the next highest country, Iraq (Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), 2022).\n",
    "**Renewable Energy**\n",
    "Installed renewable power generation capacity sat at approximately 56 GW in 2020, equivalent to 21% of the country’s total power generation capacity, with hydropower representing by far most of the installed renewable energy capacity (52 GW) (IEA, 2021b).\n",
    "Under stated policy projections, there is a slight upward trend in the share of renewable sources in total primary energy supply from around 3.4% in 2020 to 4.4% by 2030 (IEA, 2021b).\n",
    "In 2009, Russia established a 4.5% renewable electricity generation target, excluding large hydropower, by 2020 with its Energy Strategy to 2030 (IRENA, 2017). In 2013 this target was revised down to at least 2.5% by 2020 through the State Programme for Energy Efficiency and the Development of the Energy Sector, and the original 4.5% renewable electricity target was pushed back to 2024 (IRENA, 2017).\n",
    "Russia missed its 2020 target and will not meet it 2024 target, given that in 2021 only 0.47% of Russia’s electricity came from non-hydro renewables (BP, 2022; Proskuryakova, 2022). This extremely low share stands in contrast to the global average of over 10.2% (BP, 2022). The lack of projected progress on increasing uptake of renewable energy in Russia is shown below. The figure includes electricity generation from large hydro.\n",
    "\n### Share of renewable electricity generation\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "Russia’s long-term climate strategy includes a commitment to achieve a modal shift for passenger and freight transport to less carbon intensive modes of transport (Russian Federation, 2022c). In addition to this commitment, Russia also took concrete steps to decarbonise its transport sector.\n",
    "Electric vehicles (EVs) sales in Russia in 2021 have tripled to 2,254 (Bouckley, 2022). In an attempt to continue a trend of increased EV demand, in August 2021 the government approved an EV concept that targets the construction of 9,400 charging stations and local manufacturing of at least 25,000 EVs by 2024, reaching at least 72,000 charging stations and a 10% EV share of total vehicle manufacturing by 2030 (Kalinin et al., 2021; Russian Federation, 2021b).\n",
    "However, the current economic sanctions imposed on Russia have limited its ability to import key technological components, such as semiconductors, causing the domestic production of automobiles to plummet because of the shortages (Bogdanova, 2022). Along with measures promoting EV production, the government plans to stimulate demand by providing subsidies covering up to 25% of the price of domestically produced EVs (Reuters, 2021).\n",
    "In November 2021, Russia released the Transport Strategy Until 2030. The strategy includes measures for energy-efficient or electric vehicles, low-carbon infrastructure, and alternative fuels intended to reduce transport emissions by 1.2% relative to total emissions in 2017 by 2030 (Russian Federation, 2021c). The CAT has not quantified this target. This target is not ambitious enough given the level of decarbonisation expected for key benchmarks in the transport sector (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).\n",
    "However, there are no measures targeting other areas; there are no plans to phase out sales of fossil fuel passenger cars or heavy duty vehicles, while there are also no fuel efficiency standards in place.\n",
    "Russia’s land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector has been a large sink since the mid-1990s, reaching a maximum of -720 MtCO2e in 2010 (36% of total non-LULUCF GHG emissions) (Russian Federation, 2022b). This has since declined to -569 MtCO2e in 2020 (Russian Federation, 2022b). In its recently submitted long-term climate strategy, Russia projects its removals in 2050 to reach -1,200 MtCO2e from -539 MtCO2e in 2030. These removals are projected to be achieved via LULUCF sinks, but there is no information available in the strategy to substantiate such an enormous increase.\n",
    "In February 2021, Russia’s Environment Ministry announced it would be changing its accounting method for calculating the size of Russia’s forestry sink in its favour, intending to include unmanaged “reserve” forests alongside managed forests in its GHG inventory (Light, 2021). This violates a key element of international climate reporting, with the UN’s IPCC guidelines stating that only managed forests may be included in carbon accounting practices (IPCC, 2006). The Ministry claims that enacting this accounting change could increase absorption by almost 500 MtCO2 annually (Light, 2021). This could partially explain why the LTS assumes Russia’s LULUCF sink will be twice as high in 2050, but no explanation is provided in the LTS.\n",
    "It would also, assumedly, include the large scale emissions caused by forest fires that have been intensifying in recent years due to unprecedented heat waves in Northern regions, including a record 18.8m ha of forest destroyed in 2021 alone and at least three million hectares in 2022 (The Moscow Times, 2022a, 2022b). Nevertheless, Russia’s Fourth Biennial Report projects a LULUCF sink of -246 MtCO2e in 2030 under a “with measures” scenario or a maximum sink of -509 MtCO2e in 2030 “with additional measures”(Russian Federation, 2019b). A decline in forestry removals would make the government’s 2060 net zero emissions target significantly more difficult to achieve.\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Historical emissions levels are taken from the inventory data submitted to the UNFCCC until the last available year, here 2020 (Russian Federation, 2022b).\n",
    "To estimate emissions for 2021, we applied a gas-by-gas approach. We applied growth rates from PRIMAP to historic 2020 emissions for each gas (Gütschow & Pflüger, 2022).\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "The NDC target is calculated using LULUCF projections from the Fourth Biennial Report to the UNFCCC and historic emissions from the latest inventory data (Russian Federation, 2019a, 2022b). For the 2030 NDC target, we assume that LULUCF emissions are included in the NDC target.\n",
    "The 2060 net zero target is calculated by assuming that Russia’s LULUCF sink for 2050 (-1200 MtCO2e) would remain constant until 2060 (Russian Federation, 2022c). We make this assumption because Russia’s LTS does not have a projection to 2060 which would outline what the level of reductions required to reach net zero emissions.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "The lower bound of our current policy projection until 2030 is primarily based on the World Energy Outlook (WEO) 2021 Stated Policy scenario projections for CO2 from energy related activities (IEA, 2021b). For non-CO2 emissions, we use the US EPA’s growth rates for non-CO2 emissions and extrapolate the historical trend (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019). We harmonised these projections to our 2021 estimate.\n",
    "The upper bound of our current policy projection until 2030 is primarily based on the APEC Outlook for Russia for CO2 emissions (APEC, 2022). While CO2 from industrial processes is included in WEO 2021 projections, we assume that it is not included in APEC projections because the ratio of CO2 emissions from industry to total CO2 emissions is lower in APEC than WEO projections (APEC, 2022; IEA, 2021b). Therefore, we adjusted the APEC scenario by applying the ratio of WEO’s industry emissions to total CO2e to calculate additional CO2 emissions from industrial processes for APEC industry CO2 emissions. For non-CO2 emissions, we use the US EPA’s growth rates for non-CO2 emissions and extrapolate the historical trend (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019). We harmonised these projections to our 2021 estimate.\n",
    "Previously, we quantified a flaring gas limit and a renewable electricity generation target. We have excluded these targets from the scenario because current policies do not indicate that these targets will be met.\n",
    "Both the WEO and APEC scenarios take into consideration the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAT has not quantitatively assessed the long-term effect of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and its numerous implications, for example with regards to a decrease in fossil fuel exports or potential economic decline in Russia.\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potentials\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Russia’s updated NDC, put forward in November 2020, with an emissions reduction target of at least 30% below 1990 levels by 2030 does not represent an increase in climate action, as it is simply the lower bound of the previous target’s range (25-30%). The CAT estimates that Russia can easily reach this target with current policies and should, therefore, submit a stronger 2030 target.\n",
    "In September 2022, the Russian government submitted its long-term climate strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC. The net zero GHG emissions target for 2060 included in the LTS relies on Russia’s land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector’s negative emissions more than doubling between 2030 (-539 MtCO2e) and 2050 (-1200 MtCO2e), though the LTS provides no information to substantiate the increase.\n",
    "*For details on what we do for our Optimistic Target global temperature estimate, see the Assumptions tab.\n",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against what a country should be doing within its own borders as well as what a fair contribution to limiting warming to 1.5°C would be. For assessing NDC targets against the fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emission reductions and any emissions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.\n",
    "The CAT rates Russia's NDC target as \"Highly insufficient\" when rated against modelled domestic pathways, and \"Critically insufficient\" when rated against its fair share contribution. We assess Russia’s total fair share contribution by considering its emissions reduction target and its climate finance. Russia’s climate finance is not sufficient to improve the fair share rating.\n",
    "NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "The CAT rates Russia’s updated NDC 2030 emissions target, at least a 30% reduction below 1990 levels (incl. LULUCF), as “Highly insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic emissions pathways. The “Highly insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s domestic target in 2030 leads to rising, rather than falling, emissions and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming could reach over 3°C and up to 4°C.\n",
    "NDC target against fair share\n",
    "We rate Russia’s updated 2030 NDC target as “Critically insufficient” when compared with its fair share emissions allocation. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Russia’s target, compared to what its fair share would be in 2030, reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Russia’s target is not in line with any interpretation of fairness. Substantial improvements are needed. Some of these improvements should be made to the NDC target itself, others could come in the form of additional support for emissions reductions achieved in developing countries in the form of finance. If all countries were to follow Russia’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "Russia’s international climate finance is rated as “Critically insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Russia’s fair share rating.\n",
    "Russia’s international public finance contributions are rated as “Critically insufficient”. Russia has not made any substantial contribution to international climate finance since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. To improve its rating, Russia needs to urgently both increase its financial contributions and stop funding fossil fuels abroad.\n",
    "As of August 2022, Russia committed USD 3m in climate finance to the Green Climate Fund in the initial resource mobilisation (IRM) round and USD 10m in the first replenishment round, which lasts until 2023 (Green Climate Fund, 2022). Even considering these commitments, contributions remain critically insufficient considering the size of Russia’s economy and its historical responsibility.\n",
    "Russia actively finances fossil fuels abroad. From 2013 to 2019, Russia sent USD 1.5bn in public finance to countries in Africa and the Middle East to support fossil fuel projects (Ferris, 2021) including coal, such as in the Long Phu Coal Plant in Vietnam (Ferris, 2021; Global Energy Monitor, 2022).\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "As of October 2022, Russia had not yet submitted a strengthened NDC as requested by the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26.\n",
    "Russia formally submitted an updated 2030 emissions target to the UNFCCC in November 2020. The update did not strengthen the country’s 2030 target in any real sense, as it is higher than Russia’s own 2030 emissions projections (“with measures” scenario in the government reported projections) (Russian Federation, 2019b).\n",
    "Russia’s updated 2030 target of a 30% reduction below 1990 levels, which replaces its previous target of 25-30%, amounts to a 2030 emissions level of 2,408 MtCO2e, which is equivalent to 24% below 1990 levels, excluding LULUCF, according to CAT estimates. Given the latest emissions projections under current policies provided by the Russian Government show 2030 emissions at 2,296 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF), this does not represent an actual cut to emissions (Russian Federation, 2019b).\n",
    "Russia’s 2020 NDC is stronger on paper but does not alter the real-world trajectory of its emissions. Maintaining the same level of real-world emissions in 2030 goes against the Paris Agreement’s requirement that each successive NDC should represent a progression beyond the current one.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.\n",
    "**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**\n",
    "- **25.11.2020:** Russia formally submits NDC update to UNFCCC",
    "- **04.11.2020:** Russia adopts new 2030 target",
    "- **23.03.2020:** Russia proposed updated 2030 target",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "Russia approved its ‘Strategy of socio-economic development of the Russian Federation with low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050’ in October 2021 and submitted it to the UNFCCC in September 2022 as its long-term climate strategy (LTS) (Russian Federation, 2021a, 2022c).\n",
    "As part of this strategy, Russia has committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060. The strategy also includes a target to reduce GHG emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050, leaning heavily on negative emissions from the LULUCF sector, which are projected to more than double between 2030 and 2050, from -539 MtCO2e to -1,200 MtCO2e.\n",
    "The enormous increase in negative emissions achieved through the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector means that steep reductions in emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels would not be necessary to achieve net zero emissions. The steep increase in negative emissions raises questions as to the viability of Russia’s planned approach to reach net zero emissions given emissions from fossil fuel combustion are projected to remain high until 2050. We evaluate the target as “Poor”.\n",
