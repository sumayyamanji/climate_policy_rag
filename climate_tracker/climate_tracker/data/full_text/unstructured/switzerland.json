    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Switzerland has made notable strides in its climate policies since the last update, first with the introduction of a legally binding 2050 net zero target and more recently with the passage of the Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies, which gives significant support to renewable energy development and end-use electrification.**\n",
    "**But** **despite this progress, the Swiss government has shown a concerning unwillingness to address the implications of the recent European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruling, which underscored Switzerland’s inadequate ambition of climate policies and failure to meet necessary emission targets. This non compliance is problematic because it undermines international efforts to combat climate change and sets a concerning precedent for other countries that might be tempted to undermine similar rulings.**\n",
    "**Switzerland has yet to communicate how much of its NDC target it plans to achieve through domestic reductions versus offsets abroad. Switzerland’s engagement in bilateral agreements to “offset” part of its domestic emissions and the lack of transparency around the level of domestic emissions reduction effort in its NDC continue to risk setting a bad precedent for other countries. These actions raise concerns about the country's willingness and ability to take ambitious domestic climate action that will be needed to meet Switzerland’s legally binding net zero target. The Climate Action Tracker continues to rate Switzerland overall as “Insufficient”.**\n",
    "The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies adopted in June 2024 will substantially reduce Switzerland’s emissions towards 2030, contributing to our assessment of Switzerland’s policy projection and action now rated as \"Almost Sufficient\". The legislation includes plans to increase generation of non-hydro renewable energy more than seven-fold between 2023 and 2035. This increase is crucial for the clean electrification of other sectors. As a result, emissions are projected to decrease substantially, getting Switzerland on track to meet CAT’s estimated domestic NDC target for Switzerland while almost reaching its full NDC target including international carbon credits. This implies less need for Switzerland to offset emissions abroad.\n",
    "In its NDC, Switzerland states that it will reduce emissions at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2030, but Switzerland has not set a domestic component for this target, also not in the 2030 NDC update submitted in November 2024. The CAT estimates that 60% to 66% of these reductions are expected to be met domestically but if Switzerland wants to improve its overall rating to \"Almost sufficient”, it needs to establish a robust domestic target for 2030 which needs to lie at around **75%** of the total NDC target. However, this only brings Switzerland’s contribution to one that is consistent with pathways for below 2°C. In order to be 1.5° compatible, the NDC target needs to be lowered, and achieved entirely domestically.\n",
    "For the remaining, non-disclosed, share of its NDC target, Switzerland plans to rely on international carbon credits. Using international credits in place of cutting domestic emissions risks undermining the ambition of the Swiss target. Additionally the lack of transparency on the amount of emissions it aims to compensate hinders the assessment of the overall ambition of its emission reduction strategy. Switzerland should therefore first aim to deliver deep reductions domestically and support developing countries through providing and mobilising climate finance, instead of purchasing carbon credits which it counts against its targets. Switzerland is one of the most active countries in pursuing bilateral agreements to purchase so-called Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under the Paris Agreement, and has been criticised for its low level of ambition.\n",
    "In summary, Switzerland’s recent climate policy developments reveal significant advancements but also critical gaps that it must address to align with the latest science and the urgent need for accelerating ambition.\n",
    "- **Legally binding 2050 net zero target:** Switzerland's Climate Protection Act established a legally binding target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, creating a clear framework for long-term climate action and necessary policy adjustments. Based on improvements in scope, architecture, and transparency, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) now rates Switzerland’s net zero target as \"acceptable\" instead of \"average\".",
    "- **New Renewable Energy Act:** The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies will significantly increase the share of renewables in Switzerland's energy mix and is expected to lead to a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in an “Almost sufficient” rating for the country’s climate policies.",
    "- **Legal framework following ECHR ruling:** The European Court of Human Rights ruling in April 2024 highlighted the necessity for effective climate policies, prompting the Swiss government to take more action. Although the government dismissed the ECHR's findings, the ruling raised awareness and intensified the debate around Switzerland's climate strategy.",
    "- **Need for a robust domestic emissions reduction target that is aligned with the national 2050 net zero goal:** Switzerland currently lacks a domestic emission reduction target, which significantly undermines the credibility of its climate action towards 2030 and beyond. To achieve an overall \"Almost sufficient\" rating, Switzerland must reduce at least **75%** of the emissions reductions set in the NDC target domestically, and it must transparently communicate this and put it into law. In order to be 1.5°C compatible, however, Switzerland needs to lower its NDC target and deliver all emissions reductions within its borders.",
    "- **Better enhance international cooperation:** Switzerland should continue its efforts to cooperate with other countries to support emissions reductions outside of its borders. However, it should prioritise its fair share of climate finance to developing countries ahead of engaging in deals to transfer mitigation outcomes from other countries to offset Switzerland's own high emissions. It should only embark on such cooperative approaches, involving a transfer of mitigation outcomes from other countries, once it has set a domestic emissions reduction target in line with the 1.5°C temperature limit and provided its fair share of climate finance.",
    "\n## Description of CAT ratings\n",
    "The CAT rates each country’s targets and policies against (1) its fair share contribution to climate change mitigation considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability and equality, and (2) what is technically and economically feasible using modelled domestic pathways which in absence of a better method are based on global least-cost climate change mitigation.\n",
    "Comparing a country’s fair share ranges and modelled domestic pathways provides insights into which governments should provide climate finance and which should receive it. Developed countries with large responsibility for historical emissions and high per-capita emissions, must not only implement ambitious climate action domestically but must also support climate action in developing countries with lower historical responsibility, capability, and lower per-capita emissions.\n",
    "The CAT rates Switzerland’s climate targets, policies and finance as “Insufficient” overall. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s climate policies and commitments need substantial improvements to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Switzerland does not specify the domestic component of the 2030 emissions reduction target.\n",
    "Based on our estimations, the domestic target would be rated “Insufficient” with keeping warming below 2°C. To improve its rating, Switzerland should set a domestic target that accounts for at least 75% of the anticipated emissions reductions under the NDC target. If fully implemented, Switzerland’s current policies and actions would be rated “Almost sufficient”, meaning that they are consistent with keeping warming below ­– but not well below – 2°C. This would be enough to achieve CAT’s estimated domestic target.\n",
    "Switzerland’s efforts to tackle climate change are heading in the right direction, since passing the new Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energy in June 2024.. Under current policies, we estimate that Switzerland will reach emission levels of around 28 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), reaching CAT’s estimated domestic NDC target for Switzerland of 35-38 MtCO2e.\n",
    "The CAT rates Switzerland’s current policies as “Almost Sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost Sufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s climate policies and action until 2030 are not yet consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit but could be with moderate improvements. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach below—but not well below— 2°C .\n",
    "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "In its updated NDC, Switzerland removed the domestic emissions reduction component but continues to mention that an undefined portion of emission reductions will be achieved through the support of action abroad and transfer of the ownership of the associated mitigation outcomes.\n",
    "Switzerland first aimed at achieve 75% of the emissions reductions of the NDC target (which is 50% reductions by 2030 below 1990) domestically, and later reduced this number to 66% in Swiss legislation and draft law documents, but finally removed it completely in the last version. Based on latest available information the CAT assesses that the Swiss government aims for domestic reduction of at least 60% to 67% of the full emissions reduction target.\n",
    "The domestic component’s removal from official documents and the ambition reduction of the domestic reduction component make it challenging to hold Switzerland accountable and raises questions about the sincerity of Switzerland's climate commitments.\n",
    "To rate Switzerland’s NDC, we use a range for the domestic component between 60% and 67% of the full target, which we rate as “Insufficient” when compared to global least cost modelled pathways. To be rated “Almost Sufficient”, this component would need to be at least 75%.\n",
    "Switzerland’s domestic component of the NDC rating against modelled domestic pathways has deteriorated compared to our previous assessment due to an update in our modelled domestic pathways to the pathways assessed in the IPPC AR6. Our newer pathways better capture national circumstances and for higher temperature levels show less room for emissions growth.\n",
    "The CAT’s assessment of the Switzerland’s total **fair share contribution** takes into account its emissions reduction target and its climate finance.\n",
    "Switzerland’s has clearly stated that a portion of emission reductions will be achieved through the support of action abroad facilitated through cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The overall target is a reduction of “at least” 50% below 1990 levels by 2030. We rate the overall target, which includes its recent bilateral agreements with over 10 countries to purchase Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), as “Insufficient” when compared to its fair share emissions allocation.\n",
    "The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s fair share target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Some of these improvements should be made by increasing the ambition in the domestic target itself, whilst others could come in the form of providing climate finance to support additional emissions reductions in developing countries, without any transfer of ownership for these outcomes. If all countries followed Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.\n",
    "If we were to rate Switzerland’s estimated domestic target against its fair share, assuming that the bilateral agreements do not lead to an overall mitigation effect, the target would be “Highly insufficient”.\n",
    "We rate Switzerland’s international public climate finance contributions as ‘Insufficient’. Switzerland has committed to increasing its climate finance and has steadily increased its spending leading to USD 411m public finance contributions in 2020. Nonetheless, this is lower than what would be required under its fair share. To improve its rating, Switzerland needs to ramp up its international climate finance contributions in the period post-2020.\n",
    "Switzerland committed to a 2050 net-zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021. The net-zero target now covers key elements and meets best practice standards for many of them. The CAT evaluates the net-zero target design as \"Acceptable\".\n",

    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Acceptable**.\n",
    "Switzerland committed to a net zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2021.\n",
    "With the new Climate Protection Act (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023) which passed in June 2023, Switzerland became the first country to enshrine its net zero target in law through a public referendum. The same law introduced binding interim and sectoral targets, and requires the parliament to develop periodic roadmaps for achieving the target. It also now covers emissions from fuels for international aviation and shipping that are refuelled in Switzerland. Based on these positive improvements across several key elements, the CAT now evaluates the scope, architecture, and transparency of Switzerland’s net-zero target as ‘Acceptable’.\n",
    "Switzerland’s target covers all sectors and gases underpinned by emissions pathway analysis and the communication of clear strategic goals and emissions targets per sector. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Switzerland’s own territory, but it reserves the right to use international offset credits, even if only for technically unavoidable domestic emissions.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Switzerland aims to reach net zero by 2050.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The target covers all GHG emissions (i.e., the 7 Kyoto gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3) and all sectors of the economy (excluding international bunkers).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – The target includes fuels for international aviation and shipping that are refuelled in Switzerland.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Switzerland reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – The Swiss Federal Council adopted the net zero target in its Long-Term Climate Strategy for Switzerland (Swiss Federal Council, 2021) and enshrined it into law in June 2023 when the Climate Protection Act passed a public referendum.",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Switzerland specifies separate emission reduction and removal targets. In its LTS, Switzerland outlines indicative targets for emissions removal needs per sector for 2050.",
    "- **Review process** – The Climate Protection Act mandates the Federal Council to submit timely proposals to the Federal Assembly for the implementation of the objectives of the net zero target in at least three predefined review cycles (2025-2030; 2031-2040; 2041-2050).",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Switzerland transparently outlines its assumptions for carbon dioxide removals to achieve its net zero target, but does not clarify whether it intends to rely on LULUCF sinks.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – Switzerland provides strategic goals and emissions targets per individual sectors and comprehensively outlines the respective challenges. For example, Switzerland pursues the objective of having a net zero buildings sector by 2050, 90% emissions reduction below 1990 levels in the industry sector by 2050, and land transport that does not generate emissions in 2050 with few exceptions. In doing so, Switzerland elicits some actionable medium-term measures to reach net zero in the long term but only with limited detail.",
    "In the Climate Protection Act of 2023, Switzerland now also has legally binding interim (2040) and sectoral (industry, transport, buildings) targets.\n",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Switzerland makes no reference to fairness or equity in the context of its net zero target. It does not address the gap between its net zero target considered realistic domestically and what would be a fair target.",
    "For further information on the targets Switzerland has adopted, see the targets tab here.\n",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target Overview\n",
    "Switzerland’s 2035 NDC target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 65% compared to 1990 levels represents an absolute increase in ambition compared to its 2030 target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 50% compared to 1990 levels. However, a substantial gap remains between the target and the modelled domestic pathway (MDP). In fact, this gap has increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and the failure to narrow it in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target. A positive development is that the new NDC now outlines sectoral plans and interim targets covering buildings, transport, industry and other sectors, and commits to expanding renewable energy capacity in line with the global tripling renewables target.\n",
    "A key concern remains: the lack of transparency regarding the share of emission reductions achieved domestically versus through international carbon credits. Without a clear breakdown of domestic reduction versus purchase of international credits, it is difficult to assess whether Switzerland’s efforts are in line with 1.5°C-compatible domestic pathways. The government has stated that the share of international reductions will decrease post-2030 – but it still hasn’t disclosed pre-2030 levels and has again failed to provide specific details on how it intends to cut emissions domestically, leaving uncertainties about actual ambition.\n",
    "The CAT has therefore again had to make assumptions to quantify the 2035 target, applying the same assumptions we used for the 2030 target, specifically that 60 to 67% of the target will be realised domestically. The reliance on market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement's Article 6 without a specified reduction share limits transparency and could allow for loopholes that delay meaningful domestic action. Switzerland should provide a transparent and well-defined domestic emissions reduction target, ensuring that its commitments contribute meaningfully to global climate efforts.\n",
    "Switzerland submitted its 2035 NDC mitigation target on 29 January 2025, setting a 2035 target of a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65% below 1990 levels. This target covers all gases and sectors except international aviation and maritime transport. The CAT excludes emissions or removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) from this target, resulting in emission levels of 18.8 to 19.2 MtCO2e in 2035. However, as Switzerland continues to realise some of its emissions reductions abroad, again without specifying this share, it is not possible for the CAT to assess the target without making some assumptions. If 60 to 67% of the emissions reductions were realised domestically, it would lead to emissions levels of 30 to 33.5 MtCO2e in 2035.\n",
    "The estimated domestic component of the newly submitted NDC of 30 to 33.5 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C-compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it falls far short of the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 18.7 MtCO2e, excluding LULUCF. The CAT therefore rates this target as insufficient. If Switzerland scaled up its domestic action with the aim of realising the full target of 18.8-19.2 MtCO2e domestically, it would fall into the almost sufficient category, just on the edge of 1.5° compatible.\n",
    "Switzerland's domestic 2035 NDC is set substantially higher than the current policy projection, meaning that without additional effort Switzerland is on track to meeting the target. This highlights the low level of ambition of the 2035 target.\n",
    "Switzerland’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 mitigation target. A failure to substantially increase the ambition of Switzerland’s 2030 targets and action would mean limiting peak global warming to 1.5°C will be more difficult, and deeper and more rapid emissions reduction targets will be required elsewhere, which will likely lead to a multi-decadal, high overshoot of this limit, even if followed by strong 2035 targets.\n",
    "\n## Ambition\n",
    "For the world to have a significant chance of limiting warming to 1.5˚C, governments must switch to emergency mode and strengthen both their 2030 targets and current policies to include substantial emissions cuts and significantly contribute to closing the 2030 emission gap. Switzerland’s submitted 2035 NDC target did not increase the ambition of its 2030 target.\n",
    "Switzerland’s 2035 NDC target is more ambitious than its 2030 target, aiming for a 65% reduction compared to a 50% reduction below1990 levels. The average annual emissions reduction is also higher – at 59% between 2031 and 2035, compared to 35% between 2021 and 2030. However, this increase follows a steady, linear path rather than a significant ramp-up of ambition, as it continues the same rate of reductions already required to meet the 2030 target. Therefore, a substantial gap remains between the new target and the modelled domestic pathway (MDP). This gap has even increased both in absolute and relative terms compared to the 2030 target, and the failure to narrow it in the latest update raises concerns about the level of ambition of the new target.\n",
    "The NDC states that the share of emission reductions realised abroad will decrease for the 2031–2035 period compared to the pre-2030 period, so 2035 target’s ambition ultimately hinges on the level of this announced decrease. What is alarming with this statement is that the domestic reduction versus use of credit ratio for pre-2030 levels remains entirely unclear with just five years to go and this new NDC provides little clarity, leaving high uncertainties on the actual scale of domestic action.\n",
    "The estimated domestic component of the newly submitted NDC of 30–33.5 MtCO2e in 2035 is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways because it falls far short of the 1.5°C compatible threshold of 18.7 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF. The CAT therefore rates this target as insufficient. If Switzerland were to scale up its domestic action with the aim of realising the full target of 18.8-19.2 MtCO2e emission levels domestically, it would fall into the almost sufficient category, just on the edge of 1.5° compatible.\n",
    "The 2035 NDC target includes sectoral plans and targets in buildings, transport, industry and other (agriculture, waste, F-gases) sectors. Its annex outlines Switzerland’s renewable generation targets.\n",
    "Switzerland’s sectoral plans and targets align with the Global Stocktake (GST) and commitments such as tripling renewable energy capacity, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and ending deforestation by 2030.\n",
    "The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply from Renewable Energy Sources directly supports the GST renewable energy target, while the country also claims its transition away from fossil fuels and electrification of transport are in line with global net zero ambitions. Switzerland's biodiversity strategy and forest conservation laws also reinforce its commitment to halting deforestation, aligning with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\n",
    "Its participation in initiatives like the Global Methane Pledge and the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability further reflects Switzerland's commitments to align with broader global climate goals. However, ongoing assessments will be crucial to ensure these sectoral measures contribute effectively to achieving international climate targets.\n",
    "Further information on Switzerland’s net zero target can be found here.\n",
    "\n## Fairness & Finance\n",
    "Developed countries need to significantly scale up international climate finance and other means of support. Developed countries should set 1.5°C aligned domestic mitigation targets in their NDCs and communicate the financial and other support they will provide to developing countries. Developing countries should clearly communicate the climate finance they need to set and achieve ambitious 1.5°C aligned conditional targets.\n",
    "Our methodology makes it clear that developed countries should set NDC targets that are at least compatible with their 1.5°C modelled domestic pathways and should meet these targets within their own borders and using their own resources. Switzerland’s submitted 2035 NDC is not 1.5°C compatible against modelled domestic pathways.\n",
    "Developed countries are also expected to complement their ambitious domestic mitigation efforts with significant financial support for mitigation in other countries. Switzerland has communicated that it assesses its fair share of the USD 100bn to be between CHF 450–600m (~USD 290-650m) per year and intends to continue to mobilise that amount. However, with COP29 setting a new climate finance goal of USD 300bn annually by 2035, current levels of commitment fall short of the increased ambition now required. To align with the new global target and ensure adequate support for developing countries, Switzerland will need to scale up its climate finance contributions.\n",
    "\n## Credibility\n",
    "Credible NDCs should build on robust national planning processes that translate the economy-wide emissions reduction target into action in all sectors. Governments need to ramp up the implementation of their existing targets and further develop policies to close the – still significant – emissions gap between current policies and 1.5°C. Contradictory policies must be addressed and reversed: fossil fuel production needs to be phased out, while fossil fuel exploration and fossil fuel subsidies need to stop.\n",
    "Switzerland is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, already experiencing a temperature increase of 2.8°C above pre-industrial levels, which underscores the urgency of its climate commitments.\n",
    "The government claims to have successfully achieved prior targets, including its objectives under the Kyoto Protocol – although this assertion is only accurate when emissions reductions realised through offsets abroad are taken into account.\n",
    "The second NDC was developed through a rigorous national planning process that incorporated public participation. It outlines a clear institutional framework for implementation, supported by the Climate and Innovation Act, which establishes intermediate targets and a long-term pathway toward achieving net-zero emissions. The NDC emphasises a focus on overall emissions reductions and sectoral strategies to address climate challenges. This context highlights Switzerland's proactive approach to balancing its climate commitments with the need for an effective energy policy.\n",
    "However, Switzerland is one of the countries with a notable disparity between production-based and consumption-based emissions, meaning that while it may exhibit progress in reducing emissions attributed to domestic production, it effectively imports a considerable amount of emissions tied to the goods and services consumed by its population. Consequently, the decoupling of emissions from economic growth may appear valid in theory, but in practice it masks Switzerland’s reliance on imported emissions, which are not adequately accounted for in its climate strategy.\n",
    "\n## Transparency\n",
    "Governments should set absolute, economy wide, emission reduction target trajectories including all GHG gases, specifying the emissions levels for each year as an absolute level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) so they are clear, transparent, and immune to creative accounting. NDC targets should primarily focus on their domestic reductions by decarbonising all sectors of the economy rather than relying on forestry sinks, other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) or international carbon markets.\n",
    "Switzerland's second NDC is based on fixed values for emission reductions compared to 1990 values. The target covers all sectors, including energy, agriculture, and waste, and includes all major greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. The emissions pathway outlined features clear intermediate sectoral targets and legislative measures aimed at meeting them. However, the sectoral targets fall short of the overall reduction goal, cumulatively leaving a gap of over 10 MtCO₂ and bringing domestic reductions to less than 50%. This shortfall is likely to be covered by offsets under Article 6 rather than actual emission cuts. Furthermore, the target does not clearly separate the contributions from land use and forestry as well as other CO2 removal methods.\n",
    "Switzerland's second NDC lacks transparency regarding the share of reductions that will come from carbon credits under Article 6, as it continues with vague statements like: “The share of emission reductions realised abroad will decrease for the 2031–2035 period compared to the pre-2030 period, consistent with the principle of progression. The percentage of domestic emission reductions will be determined in the context of parliamentary deliberations on the CO2 Law for the post-2030 period”.\n",
    "The omission of a clear domestic component complicates accountability, as neither the CAT nor other stakeholders can assess how much of the target is achieved through international market mechanisms versus domestic actions. The unspecified role of credits furthermore creates uncertainty around the integrity of the emission reduction strategy. We have criticised this in the past – as this also applies to the 2030 target – and this new announcement does little to address those concerns. Ultimately, this ambiguity hinders Switzerland's ability to demonstrate effectiveness and transparency in meeting its climate obligations.\n",

    "# Policies & action",
    "Switzerland’s efforts to tackle climate change are heading in the right direction again, since passing the new Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies in June 2024. Under current policies, Switzerland is projected to achieve even its not specified, estimated domestic target of a 30% to 33% reduction below 1990 levels.\n",
    "The CAT rates Switzerland’s current policies as “Almost sufficient” when compared to modelled domestic pathways. The “Almost sufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s climate policies and action in 2030 are not yet consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming could be held at – but not below – 2°C.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Switzerland’s emissions decreased from 45 MtCO2e in 2021 to 41 MtCO2e in 2022, 25% below 1990 levels. The decrease from 2021 to 2022 was mainly driven by a lower demand for gas and heating fuel in the building sector due to the warmer than average winter and subsequently lower need for space heating.\n",
    "The new Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies (Bundesgesetz Über Eine Sichere Stromversorgung Mit Erneuerbaren Energien, 2024), approved in a June 2024 referendum, greatly impacts emissions projections under current policies, potentially leading to emissions levels as low as 28 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) by 2030. This projected reduction is equivalent to almost 50% reduction below 1990 levels (excluding LULUCF). Switzerland would therefore meet its estimated domestic target of a 30% to 33% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels under current policies and would get very close to meeting its overall NDC of a 50% reduction below 1990 levels through even without the use of carbon credits from international mechanisms.\n",
    "The CO2 Act is the key policy addressing emission reductions in Switzerland. To implement the Paris Agreement in Swiss legislation, an amendment of the CO2 Act (known as Total Revision) was drafted to make the 2030 NDC target legally binding (Schweizer Parlament, 2020). However, the Act was rejected in a public referendum in 2021, forcing Switzerland to extend its expired and unambitious CO2 Act to 2024 and start a process of drafting a new amendment.\n",
    "A new amendment of the CO2 Act (known as CO2 Succession Act) was subsequently presented and accepted by parliament in March 2024. This version, however, includes substantially weaker provisions than the original, and all draft versions appear to have decreased in ambition in every round; i.e. there is no longer a clear domestic emissions reduction target, and all bans were removed from the original text.\n",
    "Besides the 2030 target, the Act includes measures across various sectors including buildings, transport, industry, and aviation. It also covers climate adaptation support, support for companies exposed to the emissions trading system, and cleaner energy technologies like biogas and renewable fuels (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO2-Emissionen (CO2-Gesetz), 2024). As this piece of legislation is still open for public consultation and amendments, and will only come into effect in 2025, it is not yet included in current policy calculations.\n",
    "On 18 June 2023, the Swiss people accepted another important piece of legislation in a public referendum, the Federal Act on Climate Protection Objectives, Innovation and Enhancement of Energy Security (the Climate Protection Act). It enshrines the net-zero emissions target for Switzerland by 2050 in law and sets interim and sectoral targets.\n",
    "The Climate Protection Act also promotes innovation by providing support for companies to achieve their net zero target, addresses energy security through a programme that funds the replacement of fossil-fuel and electric resistance heating systems and covers adaptation support. The Act, however, is mainly a framework law, mandating the parliament to work out more concrete objectives and measures to meet the 2040 and 2050 sectoral targets. The Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies (see below) is set out to address this to some extent.\n",
    "Switzerland introduced a carbon levy charged on fossil fuels in 2008, which covers ~35% of CO2 emissions. The fee was repeatedly raised over time, culminating at CHF 120 per tonne of CO2 (USD 130) in 2022, making it the highest CO2 levy in Europe (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, 2021) (Alex Mengden, 2024). The CO2 Succession Act proposes to avoid many taxes altogether in favour of tax incentives and funding instruments in the transport, buildings, and industry sectors. The emphasis of Swiss climate policy is increasingly focussing on incentives rather than bans and restrictions, in order to avoid more rejection at the ballot, which means it includes some exemptions to the CO2 levy, including plant operators that commit to reducing emissions by 2040.\n",
    "The majority of the proceeds from the levy are reimbursed to the citizens, or they flow into the (new) buildings programme and the economy. In 2023, the total revenue from the levy was around CHF 1.1 bn (USD 1.3 bn), of which roughly two thirds was redistributed to the population and the rest to the economy (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024a)\n",
    "Another cross-sectoral instrument influencing greenhouse gas emissions is Switzerland’s emissions trading scheme (ETS). Companies participating in the ETS are excluded from an obligation to pay the emissions levy. After linking with the EU ETS in 2020, the price of Swiss emissions allowances broadly aligned with the higher EU allowance prices, which will accelerate emission reductions by the emitters responsible for a third of emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels (EEX, 2019; Swiss Federal Audit Office, 2017). In November 2019, the Federal Council expanded the scope of the Swiss ETS to include civil aviation and fossil-thermal power plants (ICAP, 2020).\n",
    "In November 2020, a group of senior women in Switzerland filed a case against the Swiss government at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), claiming that inadequate climate policies threaten their health and violate their rights to life and private life. The court ruled in April 2024 that Switzerland had failed to protect these rights from climate change impacts and lacked an effective regulatory framework to meet emission targets, marking an unprecedented application of human rights law in climate litigation.\n",
    "Despite this landmark ruling, in June 2024, the Swiss parliament rejected the ECHR's decision, arguing that the country already has an effective climate strategy and the Swiss government subsequently also dismissed the court's findings in August 2024, asserting that its climate policies are adequate and have been bolstered by recent legislation. Environmental groups criticised this dismissal, arguing that Switzerland's plans do not sufficiently address the urgent need to limit global warming to 1.5°C. The CAT echoes these concerns, indicating that while some progress is being made, Switzerland still falls short of meeting the standards set by the ECHR ruling (Domhnall O’Sullivan, 2024; Imogen Foulkes, 2024; Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, 2024).\n",
    "\n## Power\n",
    "Switzerland has the third lowest carbon intensity of electricity generation (41g CO2) in the world (Carbon Intensity of Electricity Generation, 1990 to 2023, 2024), owing to its historically highly decarbonised power system. In 2023, over 95% of electricity in Switzerland was generated from zero carbon sources, mainly from hydro (56%, mostly hydro) and nuclear (33%) (IEA, 2024). The Swiss power sector has been included in the ETS since 1 January 2020, but this only affects a small number of operators given the sector’s highly decarbonised nature.\n",
    "The **Energy Strategy 2050** became the key framework in the energy sector when it replaced the previous Energy law. The energy strategy withstood a public referendum in 2017 and contains a package of measures aiming at increasing energy efficiency, reduction of CO2 emissions, and steadily replacing nuclear energy with renewables (Bundesamt für Energie, 2018a).\n",
    "To execute the strategy, Switzerland revised its **Energy Act** (EnG) and set targets for the expansion of electricity production from renewable energy for 2020 and 2035. Switzerland exceeded the 2020 target for non-hydro renewables, but electricity generation from non-hydro renewables must increase by 450 GWh annually to meet the 2035 target of 11.4 TWh (Bundesamt für Energie, 2021).\n",
    "While it is good that Switzerland has such targets, they should not be absolute but rather as a share of total, as this better reflects the increase in energy demand due to end-use electrification. The Act also prohibits the construction of new **nuclear** power plants and states that nuclear energy shall steadily be replaced by renewables.\n",
    "The first of Switzerland's five nuclear power plants was shut down in December 2019. There is no schedule for the other four; they will likely continue running until at least 2030. In August 2024, however, the Environment Minister opened a discussion to amend the Act to again allow the construction of new nuclear plants. While this argument is based around “technology openness”, experts warn this is a derailing tactic to divert the conversation away from implementing the necessary wind and solar expansions (Sarah Schmalz, 2024).\n",
    "The Act also includes a goal for decreasing per capita electricity consumption, and introduced some changes to feed-in tariffs for renewables, including shortening the period during which new installations receive the tariffs from 20 to 15 years (Die Bundesversammlung der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaf, 2018; VSE, 2019).\n",
    "In June 2021, the **Federal Act on a Secure Electricity Supply with Renewable Energies** was launched to set out the necessary amendments to the Energy Act and the Electricity Supply Act to be aligned with the energy strategy 2050, and after several iterations it withstood a public referendum in June 2024 and now is enacted.\n",
    "It includes renewable installation targets for 2035 and 2050 of substantial scale: generation of non-hydro renewable generation needs to grow to 35 TWh in 2035 and 45 TWh in 2050 (from 4.6 TWh in 2023) while hydropower generation not go below 37.6 TWh in 2035 and 39.2 TWh in 2050. The Act further includes demand targets to enforce improvements in energy efficiency and includes electricity import thresholds. It also includes specific market-oriented support mechanisms such as the introduction of competitive tenders and investment contributions, phase-out of feed-in tariffs and expansion of market premiums.\n",
    "Another central part is the a mandatory construction of rooftop PV for new buildings, but this was weakened to only include buildings with a chargeable building area (roofs or facade) of over 300m2.(Bundesgesetz Über Eine Sichere Stromversorgung Mit Erneuerbaren Energien, 2024; IEA, 2024).\n",
    "For energy security reasons, Switzerland is highly dependent on traded electricity with its neighbouring countries. Since 2007, non-EU member Switzerland has been negotiating with the EU to form an agreement to better integrate its own market with the EU electricity market. When negotiations on institutional bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the EU were abruptly terminated in 2021 (based on non-energy/climate related issues), discussions on Switzerland’s access to the European electricity market were also put on hold. As a result, Swissgrid, the Swiss grid company, has had to negotiate technical, private-law agreements with European transmission system operators.\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "Emissions from manufacturing industries, construction and industrial processes and product use (IPPU), accounted for 23% of Switzerland’s CO2 emissions in 2022. These levels are almost equal to those in 1990 (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b). With Switzerland's new Climate Protection Act that passed a referendum in 2023, Switzerland now has emissions reductions targets for the industry sector to reduce emissions by 50% by 2040 and by 90% by 2050 below 1990 levels (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023).\n",
    "Most GHG emission reduction policies and measures affecting Switzerland’s industry sector are implemented under the CO2 Act and cover CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use. These include the CO2 levy on heating and process fuels, the Swiss ETS, and the negotiated reduction commitments. A number of key non-CO2 emissions are not covered under the Act, and have been targeted separately. For example, a number of provisions relating to substances stable in the atmosphere cover all F-gases and are expected to result in a reduction of roughly 1.1 MtCO2e in emissions of such gases in 2020 (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2020c).\n",
    "Similar to the EU, Switzerland also uses an ETS to lower emissions from large, energy-intensive entities. The Swiss ETS is much smaller than the European ETS, not only because of the smaller market but also due to the fact that the emissions generated by 54 companies in the power, cement, pharmaceutical, refinery, paper, district heating, and steel sectors covered by the scheme represent only 10% of the country’s emissions.\n",
    "Emissions from the sector were capped in 2013 at 5.63 MtCO2, and required to reduce by 1.74% per year in order to reach a target of 4.91 MtCO2 in 2020 (13% reduction on 2013 levels) (Mission of Switzerland to the European Union, 2017). From 2021, the annual required rate of reduction rose to 2.2% of the 2010 baseline, which applies until 2030 (Federal Office of the Environment, 2020).\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "Emissions from the transport sector were responsible for 33% of Switzerland’s total GHG emissions in 2022, almost exclusively from road transport (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b). Since peaking in 2008, transport emissions have steadily been decreasing and in 2020 they fell below 1990 levels for the first time since 1996, primarily due to lower car travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "Emissions only slightly rebounded in 2021 and even slightly decreased again in 2022, remaining at 7% below 1990 levels. With the adoption of the Climate Protection Act in 2023, Switzerland now has reduction targets for the transport sector to reduce emissions by 57% by 2040 and by 100% by 2050 (below 1990 levels) (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023).\n",
    "Given the very low emissions intensity of Switzerland’s power sector, a shift to electric mobility has an even higher impact on overall emission reductions. In 2023, 30% of all new passenger cars sold in Switzerland were electrically chargeable vehicles, which includes battery-only (21%) and plug-in hybrid (9%) vehicles (European Alternative Fuels Observatory, 2024a). Although the uptake of electric vehicles is accelerating, the share of new sales in Switzerland remains significantly below that of some countries with a comparable level of income (e.g. 60% in Sweden, 55% in Finland, 90% in Norway in 2023), but it is moving faster than the EU27 average, which in 2023 was 23% (European Alternative Fuels Observatory, 2024b).\n",
    "The target of 15% battery electric vehicle sales in 2022, outlined in the Roadmap for Electric Mobility 2022, was met a year early leading to the creation a new Roadmap for Electric Mobility 2025, with 2025 targets of EV market sales shares of 50% and of 20,000 charging stations. Although the EV uptake is expected to take an exponential trajectory to achieve 50%, sales need to more than double within two years (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2023)(Bundesamt für Strassen ASTRA, 2023).\n",
    "While still predominantly on road, the share of freight transported by rail – which is electrified to 99.8% in Switzerland – is slowly growing again and reached 38% in 2022. This is higher than even the EU target for 2030, which is 30% and the current EU average was 18% in 2021 (Bundesamt für Strassen BFS, 2023).\n",
    "The inclusion of domestic and international aviation between Switzerland and member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) into Switzerland’s ETS since 1 January 2020 is a significant policy development, with emissions from the sector in the scheme to be capped at 2018 levels (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2020c). In addition, from 2020 for new designs, and from 2023 for in-production models, aircraft in Switzerland will be subject to CO2 emission reduction targets. Switzerland also participates in the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international civil aviation (CORSIA), under which emissions are capped at 2019 levels. Despite becoming more stringent in 2024, this scheme has significant shortcomings, meaning it is unlikely to deliver the substantial reductions needed to achieve the ICAO’s aspirational goal of carbon neutral growth from 2020.\n",
    "Within the framework of the new CO2 Succession Act, the introduction of a sustainable aviation fuel blending mandate is planned, in coordination with the EU’s ReFuel programme from 2025 and it also includes instruments to support the conversion of diesel-powered buses and ships to fossil free alternatives. The CO2 Succession Act further introduces quantitative emissions reduction targets for the period after 2025 aligned with those of the EU. It also introduces a new penalty for exceedance of emissions limits at CHF 95 to CHF 152 (USD 119 to USD 176) for each gram of CO2/km exceeding the individual target (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO2-Emissionen (CO2-Gesetz), 2024).\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "In 2022, the buildings sector, including commercial and residential, was responsible for roughly 23% of Switzerland’s total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF), a decrease from 1990 levels when they represented around 30% of the country’s emissions. The warm winter of 2022 and subsequent lower demand for emissions intensive heating, contributed to this low number, which – in absolute terms – fell below 10 MtCO2e for the first time, a reduction equivalent to 44% below 1990 levels (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b).\n",
    "While missed in 2020, for the first time the achieved emission reduction in 2022 was larger than the goal of a 40% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 that was adopted in the 2012 CO2 Regulation (Der Bundesrat, 2012). With the adoption of the Climate Protection Act, Switzerland now has targets for the buildings sector to reduce emissions by 82% by 2040 and by 100% by 2050 (below 1990 levels) (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023).\n",
    "Within this same Climate Protection Act, a programme to replace fossil-fuelled heating systems with renewable energy sources is prominently featured. The programme receives an annual budget of CHF 200 million (USD 230 million), partly cross-subsidised by the CO2 levy, for 10 years by the Federal Government. Subsidy details and minimum requirements will be defined by the Federal Council (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023).\n",
    "The focus on heating systems is important, as seen by the impacts that a warmer winter have on overall emissions, and previous efforts have already shown positive results. While 37% of homes were still heated by oil heating systems in 2023, this number has decreased from 59% in 1990.\n",
    "Unfortunately, a substantial share of this reduction has been taken up by other fossil fuels, namely gas (17% in 2023, up from 9% in 1990). The share of buildings with gas heating, however, has dropped for the first time in 2023. Heat pumps are on the rise and already the main heating source in new buildings, accounting for 21% of homes in 2023 (up from only 4.1% in 2000 and 17% in 2021). In new buildings built between 2011 and 2023, 73% were equipped with heat pumps while fossil fuels like heating oil (just over 1%) and natural gas (10%) are in clear decline.\n",
    "Besides these traditional energy carriers, district heating is also playing an increasingly important role, accounting for 7% of new buildings and accounting for a total of 3.8% of total buildings in 2023 (Bundesamt für Statistik BFS, 2024).\n",
    "In Switzerland, regulations and bans on specific heating systems are usually made on the Cantonal level. The installation of new direct resistance heating – with few exceptions –­­­­­ ­is now banned in all cantons. In some Cantons, such as Zurich, a phase out for such heating systems is even planned for 2030 (buildigo, 2024). The Conference of Cantonal Energy Directors (EnDK), has proposed to the Cantons to ban installations of new oil and gas heating systems by 2030 (with few expectations) (Häne, 2023). The Canton of Zurich already has a law in place that bans the installation of fossil heaters to replace older heating systems (Kanton Zürich, 2024).\n",
    "Switzerland has several energy efficiency labels for buildings, the so called “Minergie” standards. There are three major categories: Minergie houses should not consume more than 55 kWh/m2 for new single houses and 90 kWh/m2 for renovations. For Minergie-P the standards are 50 kWh/m2 and 80 kWh/m2 respectively. For Minergie-A the standards are 35 kWh/m2 and heating should be zero or below zero. By May 2023, there were over 55,000 Minergie-certified buildings in Switzerland (Minergie, 2022). These are only certifications and not mandatory standards. Public referenda at the local level to mandate that all new buildings have certain Minergie standards have so far failed to pass.\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "Emissions from the agriculture sector in 2022 constituted around 16% of total emissions (excluding LULUCF), representing a roughly constant share of total emissions as they have been decreasing at around the same pace as overall emissions (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b).\n",
    "In 2023, Switzerland released its new **Climate Strategy for Agriculture 2050**, replacing the 2011 Climate Strategy for Agriculture with a more ambitious, comprehensive approach based on recent sustainable development and agricultural policy framework serving as a guideline for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change in the agricultural sector, with a focus on enhancing food security.\n",
    "The strategy sets three primary goals: adapting agricultural production to local climate conditions with at least 50% self-sufficiency rates, reducing the per capita ecological footprint of diets by two-thirds from 2020 levels, and cutting agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 (this shows an increase in ambitious from a previous one third increase) (Bundesamt für Landwirtschaft BLW; et al., 2023). The strategy includes some measures to achieve these targets, but the plan to make the reduction target mandatory by including it in the third CO2 Act was dropped after the rejection of the act by the Swiss electorate.\n",
    "Swiss agricultural policy reform faced a significant delay with the suspension of **AP22+,** the successor of the Agricultural Policy 2014-2017 and 2018-2021. Switzerland’s **AP 14-17** and **AP 18-21** contained the abolition of unspecific direct payments (livestock subsidies, general acreage payments), additional funds for environmentally friendly production systems, and for the efficient use of resources (e.g., increase in nutrient efficiency and ecological set-aside areas, reduction of ammonia emissions) (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2020c).\n",
    "In 2020 and 2021, Parliament halted further policy development until the Federal Council could submit a detailed report on the future direction of agricultural policy. This June 2022 report aimed to provide a long-term vision, addressing unresolved issues from previous policies and the need for more sustainable agricultural practices. Following this, work on **AP30+** began, with the Federal Council scheduled to review and discuss proposals in 2026, with hopes of finally implementing a sustainable and cohesive agricultural policy framework (Der Bundesrat, 2022).\n",
    "Switzerland’s unique direct democratic system, which allows citizens to propose constitutional amendments via initiatives, has not been effective in advancing agricultural policy reform. Despite efforts – such as the 2021 initiatives on clean drinking water and pesticide reduction, both rejected by 61% of voters, and the 2024 biodiversity initiative, rejected with 63% – all three proposals were blocked at the ballot, largely due to the strong influence of the farming lobby (Müller, 2021; Rigendinger, 2024)\n",
    "\n## Forestry\n",
    "Except for a few selected years, forestry constitutes a sink of emissions in Switzerland of between 1–4 MtCO2 annually. In the current policy scenario this is expected to remain the case until at least 2035. However, this is expected to change with additional measures, as the sector would be projected to become a source of emissions by as soon as 2025 (1.1 MtCO2) and in 2030 to 2035 reaching roughly 1.7 MtCO2e of emissions per year (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b). Roughly 31% of Switzerland’s total area is covered by forests, a value that has remained constant over the past years.\n",
    "\n## Waste\n",
    "Emissions from the waste sector in Switzerland made up roughly 3% of total GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2022 and registered an absolute decrease of almost 50% since 1990 (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b). Since 2000, the disposal of untreated municipal waste into landfill has been prohibited, with an increase in the capacity of waste incineration plants implemented to accommodate this ban (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2020c). These incineration plants have substantially reduced methane emissions from Swiss landfills and produce roughly 2% of Switzerland’s total energy consumption.\n",

    "\n---\n",
    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Historical emissions data for 1990-2022 are taken from the April 2024 update of Switzerland’s GHG inventory (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b).\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "We calculated the 2030 targets using the most recent national inventory (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b).\n",
    "Switzerland has not officially communicated the domestic share of its NDC target and has removed any specific information from the current version of the CO2 Reduction Act. In a previous draft from 2021 it stated that 33% (66% of 50%) of emissions will be reduced domestically (by 2030 below 1990 levels). From other official communication documents, it becomes evident that there is a consensus by the Federal Council that at least 30% will be reduced within the borders. After proposals for a 75% and a 70% (of the 50%) reduction were rejected in parliament in 2024, the Environment Minister Albert Rösti announced that he would propose a 66% share to the Federal Council (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024). Due to a lack of clearer information, we have therefore decided to take a range between 30% and 33% by 2030 below 1990 levels as Switzerland’s domestic share.\n",
    "Switzerland’s NDC includes LULUCF. The NDC states the desire to use a reference level for forest land, while emissions for other land uses will be included both in the target and baseline years. To assess LULUCF emissions in 2030, we take an average between the two projections WEM (with existing measures) and WAM (with additional measures) as to reach the 2030 target the emissions reduction pathway would need to be in between the two scenarios. Since there is some uncertainty on both the accounted LULUCF emissions and the target itself, we show the target as a range, with the lower end of the range representing emission levels of 33% reductions without the accounted LULUCF emissions.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "For our current policy projections, we use a study be the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW), which is the only scenario analysis identified that quantifies the impacts of the new RE Act of June 2024 (Rohrer et al., 2024). The study builds on the modelled Energy perspectives 2050+ (scenario WWB) (Bundesamt für Energie, 2022), which are also used for the “with existing measures” scenario submitted to the UNFCCC in Switzerland’s 5th Biennial Update Report (Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, 2022). The projection is then harmonised to actual 2022 emissions from the most recent national inventory (Bundesamt für Umwelt BAFU, 2024b).\n",
    "\n## Net-zero target and other long-term targets\n",
    "In its ZERO-basis scenario of the Energy perspectives 2050+, the Swiss government provides assumptions on their estimated residual emissions to meet its 2050 net-zero GHG target. The CAT approach assumes full implementation for all CDR and CCS planned for the target year, meaning that residual emissions are determined by the level of LULUCF emissions (zero assumed for Switzerland) and international offsets to compensate. Hence, the scenario “NET-ZERO scenario (EP2050+) incl. international offsets” was used, which assumes 4.7 MtCO2e of residual emissions in Switzerland in 2050 (Bundesamt für Energie, 2022).\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potentials values\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Switzerland submitted its updated NDC to the UNFCCC in December 2020, responded to paragraph 29 of the Glasgow Climate Pact and to the rejection of the CO2 Act with another update in December 2021, and submitted another update in November 2024, after the CO2 act finally passed legislation. All updates did not increase in ambition but in the 2021 update language slightly changed from the original NDC’s commitment of “a 50% reduction below 1990” levels by 2030 to “at least 50%” below 1990 levels (Swiss Confederation, 2021). In absolute terms, this translates to emissions levels of at most 27 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF by 2030. Switzerland has also committed to reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 as enshrined into law and outlined both in its NDC and LTS.\n",
    "In its updated NDC, Switzerland does not specify a domestic emissions reduction component of its 2030 target, but instead clearly states its intention to use provisions under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to offset its own emissions. In its NDC it states that “Switzerland will realise its NDC mainly domestically and will partly use internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) from cooperation under Article 6” (Swiss Confederation, 2021).\n",
    "Since the CO2 Act was rejected in a public referendum in 2021, Switzerland has passed a new amended CO2 Act in 2024, which strongly decreased in ambition (known as Succession Act). Earlier drafts in 2021 still included a targeted 33% reduction in domestic emissions, which reflects two thirds of the total emissions reduction of its 50% target (Der Bundesrat, 2021). However, since then this has been replaced by vague comments stating that “The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is primarily achieved with measures within Switzerland. The Federal Council determines the share.” (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO2-Emissionen (CO2-Gesetz), 2024).\n",
    "In January to March 2024, the matter of a domestic component was again discussed in commissions in both chambers of parliament with proposals for 75% and 70% (of the overall target to halve emissions in 2030, relative to 1990 level) on the table, but all proposals were rejected. Consequently, the Environment Minister Albert Rösti announced that he would propose a 66% share to the Federal Council (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024). Other official communications imply that at least 30% (60% of the overall target) will be targeted domestically (Botschaft Zur Revision Des CO2-Gesetzes Für Die Zeit Nach 2024, 2022(Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024)).\n",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "Switzerland submitted an update to its NDC both in December 2021 – to account for changes when the CO2 act was rejected – and again in November 2024 – when a watered-down version of the CO2 act finally passed legislation. Both updates did not increase ambition.\n",
    "A first update to Switzerland’s NDC target in December 2020 did not represent an increase in ambition, as it changed only from a 50% reduction below 1990 levels to an “at least” 50% reduction, but the domestic component of the target increased from 60% to 75%. A subsequent update to Switzerland’s NDC in December 2021, however, removed entirely any specific reference to a domestic component to its overall 2030 target. The November 2024 update also left the target unchanged and did not raise ambition, instead focusing on adapting the text to better reflect recent policy developments.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target\n",
    "- 22.12.2024: Switzerland submitted a further update to its NDC to the UNFCCC",
    "- 17.12.2021: Switzerland submitted a further update to its NDC to the UNFCCC",
    "- 09.12.2020: Switzerland submitted its new NDC target to the UNFCCC",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against each country’s fair share contribution to global climate change mitigation, considering a range of equity principles including responsibility, capability, and equality. The CAT also rates NDC targets against indicative national emissions from global least-cost emissions pathways (called modelled domestic pathways). For assessing targets against a fair share, we consider both a country’s domestic emissions reductions and any emissions reductions it supports abroad through the use of market mechanisms or other ways of support, as relevant.\n",
    "Switzerland has clearly stated that it will achieve a portion of emission reductions to meet its NDC target through the use of mitigation outcomes sourced from abroad. To rate Switzerland’s NDC target, we assess a domestic component of its NDC against what needs to happen within its border based on modelled domestic pathways and the full NDC target (reduction achieved both domestically and abroad) against what a fair contribution would be.\n",
    "Switzerland, however, has not communicated a domestic share of its 2030 target in its NDC. Instead, it has remained vague on the extent to which its NDC target will be achieved through domestic reductions. In earlier amendments of the CO2 Act, Switzerland had proposed a domestic share target of at least 75% of the full target by 2030 below 1990 (Schweizer Parlament, 2020). In a follow-up amendment of the CO2 Act (known as Succession Act) of 2021, however, it included a targeted 67% reduction of the full target (Der Bundesrat, 2021).\n",
    "This has since been replaced by vague comments stating that “The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is primarily achieved with measures within Switzerland. The Federal Council determines the share.” (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO2-Emissionen (CO2-Gesetz) (Entwurf), 2022). This wording has remains the same in the current draft of 2024 (Bundesgesetz Über Die Reduktion Der CO2-Emissionen (CO2-Gesetz), 2024).\n",
    "In January to March 2024, the matter was discussed in commissions in both chambers of Parliament with proposals for 75% and 70% (of the full target) on the table, but all proposals were rejected. Consequently, the Environment Minister Albert Rösti promised that he would propose a 67% share to the Federal Council (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024). Other official messages imply that at least 30% of emissions reductions (60% of the 50%) will be targeted domestically.\n",
    "To rate Switzerland’s NDC we have therefore had to make assumptions on the domestic component. A range between 30%, which seems to be the current consensus to aspire for (Botschaft Zur Revision Des CO2-Gesetzes Für Die Zeit Nach 2024, 2022) and 33%, which was removed from previous drafts for unknown reasons (Der Bundesrat, 2021) and was “promised” by the Environment Minister (Das Schweizer Parlament, 2024) seem to be where Switzerland is realistically headed and was thus assessed here.\n",
    "The lack of specificity regarding the proportion of emissions that Switzerland intends to reduce domestically versus abroad is problematic, as it becomes difficult to assess the effectiveness of its overall emissions reduction strategy. This makes it challenging to hold Switzerland accountable for its emission reduction commitments. Equally, the lack of transparency raises questions about the sincerity of Switzerland's commitment. It is important for governments to provide transparent information on their emission reduction plans, as reducing GHG emissions is a global effort and trust and international cooperation are key.\n",
    "Switzerland intends to achieve the remaining target through Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). Since October 2020, Switzerland has signed bilateral agreements with several countries including Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Vanuatu, Dominica, Thailand, Ukraine, Morocco, Malawi, Uruguay, Chile and Tunisia, which establish means of cooperation on the transfer of mitigation outcomes under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2024).\n",
    "While developed countries have to support mitigation in less developed countries, there is a more constructive way to pursue bilateral cooperation, which is climate finance. Governments should prioritise fulfilling their fair share of climate finance contributions before transferring mitigation outcomes supported abroad (Warnecke et al., 2021).\n",
    "To effectively address all these concerns, Switzerland should provide a clear and detailed NDC with deep emission reductions domestically, and provide sufficient climate finance.\n",
    "The CAT rates Switzerland’s estimated domestic target as “Almost sufficient” and its overall NDC target compared with its fair-share emissions allocation as “Insufficient.”\n",
    "NDC target (domestic) against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "We rate the estimated domestic component of Switzerland’s 2030 emissions target, a 30% to 33% reduction below 1990 levels, as “Insufficient” when compared with modelled domestic pathways.\n",
    "The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s domestic component of its NDC target in 2030 needs substantial improvement to be consistent with modelled domestic pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach over 2°C and up to 3°C.\n",
    "NDC target (full) against fair share\n",
    "We rate Switzerland’s overall NDC target as “Insufficient” when compared with its fair-share emissions allocation. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Switzerland’s NDC target needs substantial improvements to be consistent with its fair share of the global mitigation effort to limit warming to 1.5°C .\n",
    "Switzerland’s target is at the least stringent end of what would be a fair share of global effort, and is not consistent with the 1.5°C limit, unless other countries make much deeper reductions and comparably greater effort. If all countries were to follow Switzerland’s approach, warming would reach up to 3°C.\n",
    "Switzerland’s international climate finance is rated “Insufficient” (see below) and is not enough to improve Switzerland’s fair share rating.\n",
    "Switzerland’s international public climate finance contribution is rated “Insufficient”. Switzerland has committed to increase its climate finance and, despite a steady annual increase leading to USD 411m in 2020, its contributions to date have been low compared to its fair share. In 2020 Switzerland additionally mobilised USD 106m from the private sector and increased its specific support for bilateral adaptation activities to USD 129m (Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, 2022).\n",
    "Climate finance contributions fall short of Switzerland’s fair share contribution to the USD 100bn goal but show an increasing trend. Several recent developments indicate a commitment to international climate finance.\n",
    "Switzerland is one of the only countries that has explicitly prioritised an equal distribution of adaptation and mitigation funding for public bilateral financing (Alliance Sud, 2020). Other decisions that lead to the upward trend are the increase of the level of official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income, the gradual shift of development assistance to place an enhanced focus on climate change, and the new strategy for international development cooperation 2021–2024, which provides for an increase in funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation to CHF 400 m (approximately USD 426 m) per year by 2024 (Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, 2022).\n",
    "Switzerland remains committed to the USD 100bn goal in climate finance for developing countries per year through 2025, and it considers multilateral mobilised private climate finance as well as the full-face value of the climate finance outflow of multilateral institutions as climate finance accountable towards the 100 billion US dollars goal.\n",
    "Based on Switzerland's economic performance and the polluter-pays principle, the Swiss government estimates its fair share of international finance contributions to be around CHF 450-600m (Federal Council of Switzerland, 2017). This is close to its current investments; however, civil society organisations recommend a fair share of around CHF 1 bn per year (Alliance Sud, 2020). In addition, the USD 100bn goal itself is insufficient for the post-2020 period, and the scale of financial contributions would remain insufficient to increase Switzerland’s CAT climate finance rating. A clear and sustained increase in international climate mitigation finance is therefore needed.\n",
    "To fulfil the non-domestic component of its emissions reduction target, Switzerland is one of only a few countries that officially intends to achieve part of its NDC target through Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) on the basis of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and has already signed bilateral agreements.\n",
    "Switzerland has signed bilateral carbon credit agreements with Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Vanuatu, Dominica, Thailand, Ukraine, Morocco, Malawi, Uruguay, Chile, and Tunisia (Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, 2024). These developments are not rated in the finance component of the CAT rating. Instead, the full international NDC, that includes such agreements, is rated against Switzerland’s fair share goal - and rated “Insufficient”.\n",
    "To align with the sentiment of “highest possible ambition”, Switzerland must first set its domestic NDC within at least an “Almost sufficient” range. Although not transparently communicated (see NDC target), the estimated domestic share in Switzerland lies outside this threshold. As a second step, the country would have to provide its fair share of climate finance. This should be prioritised before purchasing credits and accounting the associated emission reductions. As Switzerland is not providing its fair share of international climate finance, the CAT does not consider it legitimate to offset for the fair share rating. Nevertheless, the CAT does acknowledge the transparency of Switzerland’s credit purchase agreements.\n",

    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "Switzerland committed to a net-zero target as part of its long-term strategy submitted to the UNFCCC in January 2021, and in June 2023, in the public referendum on Switzerland's Climate Protection Act, Switzerland's net-zero target was enshrined into law (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023). The net-zero target generally covers key elements and now meets good practice for many of them.\n",
    "Switzerland’s net-zero target covers all sectors and gases underpinned by emissions pathway analysis and the communication of clear strategic goals and emissions targets per sector. It also now covers emissions from fuels for international aviation and shipping that are refuelled in Switzerland. The proposed measures aim to achieve net zero on Switzerland’s own territory, but it reserves the right to use international offset credits, even if only for technically unavoidable domestic emissions.\n",
    "Switzerland's new Climate Protection Act, which was accepted in a referendum in June 2023, introduced interim and sectoral targets and requires the parliament to develop periodic roadmaps for achieving the target (Bundesgesetz Über Die Ziele Im Klimaschutz, Die Innovation Und Die Stärkung Der Energiesicherheit (KlG), 2023). Because of these improvements across several key elements, the CAT now evaluates the scope, architecture, and transparency of Switzerland’s net-zero target as ‘Acceptable’.\n",
