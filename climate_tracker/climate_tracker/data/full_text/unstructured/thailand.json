    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**NOTE:** This assessment is based on our September 2021 assessment with updates to the targets, net zero and Glasgow sectoral pledge sections (under policies and action), which are also reflected in the summary. Emissions pathways have also been revised due to latest historical emissions data and GDP forecasts. No policy updates were quantified in this revision.\n",
    "**Thailand’s overall climate performance has been historically weak despite some good intentions and expected forthcoming positive developments. One positive update is that Thailand raised its ambition with its** **Second NDC**** and revised** **Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy**** (LT-LEDS) in** **November 2022, which results in strengthened targets. While the updated NDC is an improvement, it does not yet reflect a fair share contribution and is still far from being 1.5°C compatible.**\n",
    "**Thailand is not projected to reach its new targets under current policies, but could reach its unconditional target under planned policies. Prior to COP26 in 2021, Thailand submitted a “carbon neutrality” by 2065 target. Thailand’s Second NDC and revised LT-LEDS now references a revised and accelerated target of “carbon neutrality” by 2050 and net zero GHGs by 2065.**\n",
    "**Thailand’s current policies projections are unable to achieve its climate commitments and signal a need to accelerate mitigation efforts, which could begin with the rollout of its planned policies. Thailand’s last shift in power sector planning, from a dependency on coal to fossil gas over the next two decades, lowers the overall emission pathways in its planned policies but nevertheless exacerbates fossil fuel (gas) lock-in and delays meaningful decarbonisation efforts. In 2022, Thailand has been focused on securing fossil supply and doubling down on gas as the energy fuel for the future, having planned a build-out of new LNG import capacity, approved a new 1,400 MW gas-fired power plant, and secured gas fields in Myanmar. The potential for renewable energy remains high and largely untapped, with deployment stagnating since pre-COVID pandemic.**\n",
    "**However, Thailand has shown a recent intent to get on track:** **the government is in the process of drafting a range of important climate-relevant documents, including its Climate Change Act and National Energy Plan (all subsumed energy documents due to be updated). In November 2022, Thailand revised its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), first submitted in September 2021. These policies will strengthen the country’s climate governance, include power sector targets with greater ambition, and also include more details on the implementation roadmap towards achieving long-term carbon neutrality and net-zero targets. Finalisation of the National Energy Plan in 2023, would increase Thailand’s renewable share targets and lower emission pathways, but will remain off of a 1.5°C compatible pathway.**\n",
    "**Until the next wave of Thailand’s climate strategies and its accompanying mitigation policies are implemented and strengthened, the CAT rates Thailand’s unconditional climate target and policies as “Critically Insufficient”.**\n",
    "The CAT rates Thailand’s overall rating as “Critically insufficient”, indicating that Thailand’s current climate policies and commitments reflect minimal action and are not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n",
    "Under Thailand’s current policies and unconditional NDC target, emissions will continue to rise and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. Thailand’s conditional target shows greater ambition, but is not yet compatible with 2°C or 1.5°C.\n",
    "For Thailand to improve its rating, it needs to establish the policies needed to curb its expected growth in emissions and plan for the long term towards deep decarbonisation. As a first step, it needs to not only solidify its energy and power sector policy plans but to revise and strengthen them to move away from decades of envisaged fossil fuel dependence. These are currently being revised in alignment with the adoption of Thailand’s new National Energy Plan due in 2023. Adoption of these plans and their embedded policy targets will lower the country’s projected emission pathway and improve its policies rating. Thailand has revised its Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy after the submission of its Second NDC.\n",
    "Thailand has announced several major policies aiming at increasing climate ambition and sustainable development in recent years but is off track in achieving its climate targets and shows little indication of implementation progress towards Paris-compatibility. We rate Thailand’s policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share.\n",
    "Thailand has plans to expand renewable energy generation, reduce energy intensity of energy sub-sectors, move towards 100% EV sales starting in 2035, and continue expansion of carbon sinks in the forestry sector. The government has also announced its preparation of a Climate Change Act, the drafting of the National Energy Plan, which is expected to provide a low-carbon roadmap towards 2050, and a possible revision of its 20-year National Strategy and National Economic and Social Development Plan to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These documents will strengthen climate governance and enhance renewable share targets, but would not be ambitious enough for 1.5°-compatibility.\n",
    "Thailand’s current and planned policies fall significantly short of any criteria for 1.5°C-compatibility, and result in an increase in domestic emissions towards 2030. Thailand’s recent shift in power sector planning from a dependency on coal to fossil gas over the next two decades lowers overall emission pathways but nevertheless exacerbates fossil fuel (gas) lock-in, and delays meaningful decarbonisation efforts. Institutional and system planning barriers for renewables remain high, leading to projections of slow growth in clean energy development.\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit.\n",
    "Thailand’s emissions rise in both its current and planned policy projections and is significantly off track when compared to its fair share trajectory. If all countries were to follow Thailand’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. The government needs to implement more stringent policies, for which it will also need additional support.\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s 2030 conditional targets as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s conditional target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. For Thailand’s target to be in line with 1.5 °C, its conditional NDC commitment would need to be a 65% reduction below the same BAU.\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s unconditional NDC target “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Thailand’s unconditional targets remain based on an inflated BAU that is significantly higher than its current and planned policy projections, even before the onset of COVID-19 or the global energy crisis. Economic trends post-pandemic now lend even more weight to the possibility that the BAU is unrealistic and should be revised downward, with a corresponding strengthening of its emissions reduction targets. If all countries were to follow Thailand’s current approach, warming would exceed 4°C. For Thailand’s unconditional target to be in line with 1.5 °C, its NDC commitment would need to be an unconditional 57% reduction below the same BAU.\n",
    "Thailand recorded a large LULUCF sink in its latest inventory equivalent to around 20% of its emissions. Thailand should work toward maintaining this sink. For more information about forestry activities in Thailand, please see the policies & action section.\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s net zero target as Average. In Thailand’s Second NDC, it references its continuing efforts “to meet the long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2065”. This supersedes Thailand’s previous ‘carbon neutrality’ target for 2065 target submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2021. Thailand officially submitted these revised targets as part of its new long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy (LT-LEDS) on 7 November 2022.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average**\n",
    "Thailand has submitted a revised LT-LEDS on 7 November 2022 at COP27, containing targets for carbon neutrality by 2050 and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2065 (ONEP, 2022). The revised targets are an acceleration of Thailand’s first LT-LEDS submitted before COP26, where Thailand committed to a carbon neutrality target for 2065 (Thailand Government, 2021).\n",
    "The targets have not yet been included in any policy document or law as of mid-November 2022 but will be included in Thailand’s first climate legislation, the Climate Change Act which is currently in review in the Cabinet. If the LT-LEDS targets are passed into law, the CAT’s rating for Thailand’s LTS would become “Advanced”.\n",
    "Thailand’s carbon neutrality and net-zero targets in its LT-LEDS covers all sectors and many of the key elements constituting a transparent and comprehensive target. Thailand’s strategic goals to reduce emissions towards mid-century and beyond depend heavily on LULUCF sinks and large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for the energy sector. Heavy reliance on CCS and LULUCF sinks should be considered a last resort for achieving Thailand’s carbon neutrality and net zero target, as implementation of CCS technologies for Thailand are uncertain and have insofar not proven to be fully effective or economically viable globally. Immediate emission reductions and build-up of clean energy technologies should remain a priority in the medium-term.\n",
    "An oil and gas CCS project is being explored by the Thai PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited at the offshore Arthit field and will likely be designed to create carbon offset units for utilisation under Japan's Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) (Mitsui & Co., 2022). Japan is understood to wish to use this pursuant to Article 6.2 of the Paris agreement and is not supporting corresponding adjustments. Hence, there is a substantial risk of double counting of emission reductions. This would mean that emission reductions could be counted both in Thailand and Japan.\n",
    "Thailand could further improve its carbon neutrality target to enhance transparency, target architecture, and scope. For example, the Thai government neither provides information on whether its targets cover international aviation and shipping nor explains why it considers the target a fair contribution to the global goal of limiting warming to 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "- **Target year** – Thailand aims to reach ‘carbon neutrality’ by 2050 and net-zero GHGs by 2065.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – The net zero target covers all sectors of the economy including energy, industry processes, agriculture, forestry and land use, and waste, though both targets include separate targets for carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – Thailand provides no information on its intention to cover international aviation and shipping.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – The LTS covers different national strategies to reduce or remove GHG emissions domestically. It does not mention any reductions or removals outside of Thailand’s borders.",
    "- **Legal status** – Thailand included its ‘carbon neutrality’ target for 2050 in its revised Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy, which the Thai government submitted to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (ONEP, 2022). Neither target has been included in any policy document or law as of November 2022, although it is slated to do so in 2023 following the finalisation of the National Energy Plan (being drafted) and the Climate Change Act (in Cabinet review). Once the law is passed, the CAT’s overall rating for Thailand’s LTS would be “advanced”.",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – Thailand communicates separate emission reduction and removal targets. It expects to reach a level LULUCF removals of 120 MtCO2e by 2037, which will stabilise until the end of the century. Negative emission technologies, such as BECCS, direct air capture and storage, and enhanced carbon sequestration through afforestation and reforestation, are all noted to play a major role to achieve carbon neutrality and net-zero targets. The LT-LEDS notes that CCS/CCUS will be required to achieve up to 90% GHG emission reduction from the cement industry. Heavy reliance on CCS and LULUCF sinks should be considered a last resort for achieving Thailand’s carbon neutrality and net zero target, as implementation of CCS technologies for Thailand are uncertain and have insofar not proven to be fully effective or economically viable globally. Immediate emission reductions and build-up of clean energy technologies should remain a priority in the medium-term. An oil and gas CCS project is being explored by the Thai PTT at the Arthit field offshore and appears to be designed to create carbon offsets units for utilisation under Japan's Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) as a pursuant to Article 6.2 (Mitsui & Co., 2022). This poses substantial risk of double counting of emission reductions, meaning that emission reductions could be counted both in Thailand and in Japan.",
    "- **Review process** – Thailand’s revised LT-LEDS does not explicitly detail its review cycle, although the first LT-LEDS established a review cycle every 5 years for its long-term strategy (Thailand Government, 2021).",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Thailand provides transparent pathways and targets for LULUCF and separately for removals and storage as part of its LTS submitted to the UNFCCC (ONEP, 2022). The Thai government aims to achieve LULUCF sinks of approximately 120 MtCO2e annually by 2037 and assumes these sinks to remain stable through the end of this century. The Thai government provides no assumptions on other carbon dioxide removal and storage technologies.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – In its LT-LEDS, Thailand shows a pathway for economy-wide emissions levels, sectoral emissions levels and LULUCF sinks until 2050 and 2065 (ONEP, 2022). The Thai government provides key mitigation actions and intermediate targets for various sectors, including:50% share of renewable energy from new power plants by 2050,share of renewable electricity is estimated to be 68% of total electricity generation in 2040, and 74% in 2050market share of battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to be 69% in 2035, with phase down of conventional vehiclesclinker substitution and substitution of high GWP refrigerants in the industrial processes sectorreplace fossil-fuels partially or completely by renewables, such as biomass and solar, and green hydrogen in manufacturingimprovement of cooling technologies such as air-conditioners and refrigeration, cooking technologies, electrical devices, and lighting technologies in buildings sector",

    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target\n",
    "Thailand has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "Thailand’s commitment to climate policy has grown in recent years but it has not yet implemented sufficient action; it must deliver more on its mitigation policies to reach its climate targets.\n",
    "Thailand is in the process of drafting a range of important climate-relevant documents, including its Climate Change Act and National Energy Plan.\n",
    "Thailand is at a crossroads in its climate ambition and emissions trajectory, as the details and targets in these upcoming plans, particularly on its efforts to shift away from fossil fuel dependence and align with Paris Agreement goals, will define the country’s climate planning for the foreseeable future. Until new robust climate policy is implemented and existing policies strengthened, we rate Thailand’s policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share.\n",
    "Under current policies, Thailand's total GHG emissions (excl. LULUCF) are projected to increase from 349 MtCO2e in 2021 to reach approximately 407 to 427 MtCO2e in 2030, an increase of 17–22%. Thailand’s emissions continue to grow substantially and is projected to miss its Second NDC targets. If Thailand implements its planned policies, including its most recent Power Development Plan and Alternative Energy Development Plan (which is under revision pending the finalisation of the National Energy Plan), its total emissions (excl. LULUCF) would reach approximately 360–379 MtCO2e in 2030. Implementing these policies, which mainly reflect efforts to replace coal with gas in the long-term energy mix, will allow Thailand to reach its unconditional NDC target but miss its conditional one.\n",
    "Thailand’s “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no meaningful action and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. The country’s emissions rise in both its current and planned policy projections and is significantly off track compared with modelled pathways. If all countries were to follow Thailand’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C. Thailand needs to implement more stringent policies, for which it will also need additional support.\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, a number of sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets. On forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they aren’t already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Methane pledge**: Thailand has not signed the Global Methane Pledge. Around 25% of its GHG emissions are from methane, with about half emitted from agriculture and a quarter from energy and waste sectors. If Thailand were to adopt the global target of a 30% reduction, this would cut emissions by about 30 MtCO2e in 2030.",
    "- **Coal exit**: Thailand has not signed the Coal Exit pledge despite a low share of coal in Thailand’s primary energy mix (13% in 2019), almost all imported. Thailand had previously shifted a planned dependency on coal in the future towards a dependence in fossil gas (33% of energy demand in 2019). This is a minor step in the right direction, but still exacerbates future fossil lock in and energy security issues.",
    "- **100% EVs**: Thailand has not signed the electric vehicles pledge, despite officials having signalled an even more ambitious target. Thailand recently raised its target of 30% share of electric vehicles in new vehicle sales by 2030 to 50%, with intentions of 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035.",
    "- **Forestry**: Thailand has signed the forestry pledge. As of 2016 Thailand’s carbon sink capacity was reported as -91 MtCO2e/year. The country has not set out any forestry targets in its NDC or but has committed to increase forest cover of the country to achieve 55% of the total country area by 2037, as described in the 20-year National Strategy.",
    "- **Beyond oil & gas**: Thailand has not signed up to the alliance, and currently has limited intention to phase out oil and fossil gas production. Thailand is a producer of both oil and fossil gas, but is also heavily dependent on imports of both fuels to satisfy domestic demand. Over 60% of Thailand’s power generation is from fossil gas. Thailand’s Ministry of Energy has stated its planning to import 36 mtpa of LNG by 2030, an increase of over 1100% from its LNG imports in 2016.",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "Thailand relies on an array of economic strategies to guide its approach to greenhouse gas emissions reductions, although so far ambitious mitigation targets and policy implementation have been lacking.\n",
    "Thailand’s approach to climate action is steered by overarching economic and development considerations from the high-level 20-Year National Strategy, which has a central goal to transform Thailand into a 'developed country with security, prosperity and sustainability'. It also relies on its 4.0 policy initiative, a development strategy that aims to transform the economy by targeting policies towards the development of ten targeted “S-curve industries” including bio-technology, future automotive, and logistics (BOI, 2018; TDPK, 2020). The shorter-term 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (NESDP 2017–2021) provides guidelines for the implementation of the National Strategy and sets economic, social and environmental targets to be achieved within five years (Office of the Prime Minister of Thailand, 2017).\n",
    "Our policies and action projections incorporates policies included at the highest level, namely the energy sector policies from the National Strategy, its Master Plans, and Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB) (2015), which encompasses the key energy planning documents (Power Development Plan (PDP) and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2015, and others) (Ministry of Energy, 2019c, 2019a). Energy sector targets have since been revised in the PDP and AEDP 2018, but have not been enshrined as the next TIEB is still under development. The PDP and AEDP 2018 make up the key policy packages underlining our planned policy projections but are not considered implemented as they will be revised again in 2023.\n",
    "The policies underlying both our current and planned policy projections, which include sectoral targets relevant to achieving the NDC, leave room for Thailand to increase ambition, as both trajectories reflect increasing emissions over the next decade and plan for a continued lock-in of fossil fuel-based energy sources. Thailand’s submitted LT-LEDS and forthcoming Climate Change Act, expected in 2022, give the country an opportunity to get itself on the right track towards Paris Agreement-compatibility (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2020b; Wipatayotin, 2020).\n",
    "Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in June 2021 the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) – in charge of the economic planning of Thailand – had announced its intention to revise the National Strategy as well as the NESDEP 2017–2021, due to the impact of the pandemic on economic growth (Arunmas, 2020; VietnamPlus, 2021). The government has so far been focusing primarily on economic recovery, rather than a green recovery, with no initial stimulus earmarked for clean energy projects (Greenpeace, 2020).\n",
    "Thailand’s Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050) defines targets, and has set a mid-term emissions reduction target in the energy and transport sectors of 7–20% below BAU by 2020. It also calls for renewable energy to provide a share of at least 25% of total energy consumption by 2021, and a reduction of energy intensity by at least 25% below BAU in 2030 (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2015). Our current and planned policy projections do not include this Plan’s targets, as the strategic documents that inform the Plan have since been outdated (e.g. PDP2010).\n",
    "Thailand is implementing a domestic carbon reduction scheme, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Scheme (T-VER), and is into the third phase of its Voluntary Emissions Trading Scheme (V-ETS), both launched in 2013. Most T-VER projects to date cover renewable energy power generation, energy efficiency and waste projects, and have so far contributed to 5.8 MtCO2e of total emissions reductions from 153 registered projects (as of October 2020). The national ETS legislation process will be kickstarted with the implementation of the Climate Change Act due in 2023 (ICAP, 2021; IEA, 2021).\n",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "The energy sector is the main source of GHG emissions within the Thai economy. In 2021, the energy sector accounted for 82% (285 MtCO2e) of the country’s GHG emissions, excluding LULUCF (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022). In 2022, Thailand has been attempting to shore up energy security primarily through means of boosting fossil fuel supply. It has recently approved the building of a new 1,400 MW gas-fired power plant, revived and delayed retirement of coal units, started construction of new LNG import terminals and gone abroad to secure gas fields in Myanmar as domestic gas production has been on the decline for several years. Fossil gas is continuing to be the primary fuel source for electricity (and second only to oil in total primary energy supply) for the next decades, with energy authorities heavily banking on LNG. LNG made up a minor portion of supply in 2016, but is expected to make up most of gas supply by 2030. The market volatility and high prices for LNG has begun to erode the case for long-term gas dependency—already, Thailand slashed its demand outlook in 2022 and needed to substitute gas for cheaper and more pollutive fuels in power plants to protect consumers.\n",
    "In 2016, 90% of electricity was generated with fossil gas, hard coal and lignite—fossil gas comprised of 67% of the total, and 10% was generated from renewables (IRENA, 2017). The electricity mix has since become slightly less dependent on fossil fuels, with 82% of electricity generated from fossil fuels and 18% from renewables in 2020 (Ember, 2021). Thailand currently relies on imports for approximately 8% of its electricity, supplied mainly from Laos, Malaysia and Myanmar in the form of natural gas, coal, and hydro. Natural gas imports from Myanmar are increasingly affected by sanctions.\n",
    "The Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint (TIEB), adopted in 2015, is comprised of five documents: the Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), the Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP), the Oil Plan and the Gas Plan. They are designed to help the country deal with the issues of increasing energy demand, import dependence and environmental concerns.\n",
    "Thailand is currently in the process of developing its first-ever National Energy Plan (NEP) due in 2023 which will serve as a master document integrating the TIEB (and sub-documents) and 20-year national strategies. The National Energy Policy Council recently approved the NEP framework, and pushed for its support to revise the PDP2018 (revision 1) and increase renewable generation in the next decade to support a transition to carbon neutrality by 2065–2070 (Thansettakij, 2021).\n",
    "The PDP, last revised in 2018 (approved 2019), is the roadmap defining targets for Thailand’s power generation, distribution, and consumption, with a goal to increase net electricity production capacity by 67%, from 46,090 MW in 2017 to 77,211 MW in 2037. It will add 56,431 MW of capacity (of which 37% should come from renewables) and retire 25,310 MW (Hong, 2019; Theparat and Praiwan, 2019). The plan also notes that by 2037, 65% of the energy mix will rely on fossil fuels (53% natural gas, 12% coal) and 35% on non-fossil fuels. Compared to the 2015 plan, the new plan reduces reliance on coal (23% to 12%) and increases dependence on gas (37% to 53%), while 9% of power is expected to come from imported hydropower.\n",
    "Renewables targets are set in the AEDP2018. Overall, renewables should reach 30% of total energy consumption by 2036, up from 12% in 2014. Heat generated from renewable sources should double, from 17% to 30–35%. The policy further notes that the production of biofuels should increase, from 7% to 20–25% of demand in the transport sector. Power capacity from renewables was to increase from 9% to 20%, but in a 2018 revision of the plan, this target was raised to 33%, notably with a more than doubling of expected solar capacity (from 6,000 to 15,574 MW by 2037) and the introduction of waste to energy (900 MW).\n",
    "The EEDP also set a target to reduce energy intensity by 30% by 2036, while the Oil Plan foresaw an increase of the share of biofuels to 20% and proposed the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. Finally, the Gas Plan highlights the need to curb demand, maintain national production levels and to secure LNG supply (Ministry of Energy, 2018).\n",
    "More recently, the government has indicated an interest in promoting rooftop solar PV installations. It first introduced a feed-in tariff in 2013, but did not attract widespread interest. The goal is to reach 50 MW electricity capacity by 2025 to help achieve the PDP goals (Praiwan, 2020).\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "Thailand has been actively prioritising decarbonisation in the transport sector, and has recently adopted several policies promoting electric vehicle (EV) uptake, railway expansion as well as the development of public transport systems.\n",
    "Following the adoption of its NDC target and a sectoral breakdown in 2015, Thailand has introduced priority measures for implementation in the transport sector. Its aim is to reduce emissions from the sector by 35 MtCO2 before 2030 off the back of over 30 planned projects, but mainly through taxing CO2 emissions, promoting low-carbon vehicles and increasing rail infrastructure (Ministry of Transport, 2019). The Sustainable Transport Master Plan identifies six main strategies to reduce GHG emissions, relying on ‘avoid-shift-improve,’ and shows a potential for reducing sectoral emissions by 26–29% by 2030 below BAU levels (Ministry of Transport, 2013).\n",
    "Thailand has both an interest in increasing production – and promoting the domestic uptake – of electric vehicles. As a major car manufacturer and in light of the growing increase of worldwide EV sales, Thailand has set a new National EV Roadmap, with an overall goal to transform the country into an EV hub within the ASEAN region. The roadmap sets future production goals, with the first target for 2025 (250 000 EVs; 3,000 electric public buses; 53,000 electric motorcycles by 2025) and a longer-term target of EVs making up 30% of production by 2030 (Amir, 2020; Apisitniran, 2020).\n",
    "In March 2021, the National New Generation Vehicle Committee chairperson announced a revision of the EV production policy, setting a target for Thailand to produce only EVs by 2035. This goal replaces the previous target which foresaw 1.1 million EVs on the road by 2025, and a rapid uptake that would lead to 5.4 million EVs by 2030 and 15.6 million by 2035 (Bangkok Post, 2021; Thanthong-Knight, 2021). However, the Electric Vehicle Association reported that as of 2020, only 4,799 EVs were registered in Thailand, an indication not only of a need for a rapid transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but also for the government to prepare the necessary infrastructure, including sufficient charging stations (Bangkok Post, 2021). The government has implemented further measures to incentivise EV production, with plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) projects being eligible for tax holidays as well as Corporate Income Tax (CIT) exemptions (Medina, 2020).\n",
    "Thailand has an excise tax on new vehicles, adopted in 2016, based on CO2 emissions intensity to help the adoption of cleaner and more efficient vehicles. The tax varies between 20–50%, depending on engine capacity and type of vehicle (Thailand Automotive Institute, 2020). The policy is expected to be revised in the near future as part of a push for quicker adoption of EVs, to meet the EV Roadmap’s objectives (GlobalData, 2021).\n",
    "The government has implemented an excise tax on fuels, and intends revising it, which could lead to higher taxes on fuels that emit more CO2, a decision in line with the emissions-based vehicle tax (Wichit, 2019).\n",
    "The Transport Infrastructure Development Strategy (2015–2022), with an earmarked budget of TBH 1.9tn (approx. USD 59bn), is expected to help Thailand develop several infrastructure projects, including intercity rail, public transport and water transport network development, highway capacity increase to connect the country’s key production areas to neighbouring countries, as well as air transport capacity enhancement (Thailand Board of Investment, 2020).\n",
    "Thailand has adopted the Transit-Oriented Development policy in September 2020, in which it has announced its intention to develop 177 railway stations throughout the country, with TBH 2.7tn TBH (approx. USD 84bn) earmarked and the plan to place the railway system at the heart of the country’s transport and logistics network (Wancharoen, 2020). A Thai-sino high-speed train project is also underway, and three contracts were recently signed. Six stations are expected to be built and construction is underway on the 253km Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima line (Railway Technology, 2021). In the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, where public transport is insufficient for the growing population and still attracting limited commuters, the 2010–2030 Railway Development Master Plan will restructure, improve and enhance the efficiency of the rail network, while the Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan will see the creation of 12 lines (509 km) of new railways (Nanthachatchavankul, no date; Ministry of Transport, 2013).\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "The industrial sector’s non-energy emissions represented approximately 10% of Thailand’s GHG emissions in 2021 (approx. 37 MtCO2), , excluding LULUCF (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022).\n",
    "Under the Climate Change Master Plan (2015–2050), Thailand has a goal to reduce GHG emissions by 7–20% below 2005 levels in the energy and transport sectors by 2020, a target subjected to international support (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2015).\n",
    "The Energy Efficiency Plan (2015–2036) sets a target of realising 14,515 ktoe of energy conservation in the industry sector to achieve a 30% energy intensity reduction by 2036 (Wongsapai, 2017). The Energy Conservation Promotion Act, amended in 2007, notes that ‘designated’ factories and buildings need to conduct an energy audit, and more generally promote energy conservation and efficiency, as well as energy recycling. It also seeks to stabilise the share of energy demand for the three most energy-intensive sectors at 40% by 2030 (EPPO, 2007).\n",
    "To transition from a manufacturing to an innovation and value-based economy, the government has proposed the Thailand 4.0 initiative. The transition should encourage environmentally friendly growth and lead to the achievement of a low-carbon society (Setsirote, 2016). While the initiative lists 10 key industries that are expected to be developed (including low-carbon automotive, smart electronics or biofuels) and states that the Eastern Economic Corridor is at the centre of this transformation, it provides no clear targets for decarbonisation nor emission reductions.\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "The agriculture sector, emitting primarily non-CO2 gases, accounts for almost 20% (69 MtCO2e) of Thailand’s total GHG emissions in 2021 excluding LULUCF (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022). Sixty percent of those emissions stem from rice production (Nama Facility, no date). This sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, while facing several structural challenges, among them small farm sizes, poverty and indebtedness, ageing of the workforce, water scarcity, and soil degradation (UN Thailand, 2020).\n",
    "To tackle some of those issues, the government has developed the 20-Year Agricultural and Cooperatives Strategy (2017–2036) and the Five-Year Agriculture Development Plan (2017–2021) under the goals of the 20-Year National Strategy and the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan.\n",
    "The Strategy contains several goals regarding farmer income, productivity increase and quality standards, as well as the need to develop ‘smart farming’ (an initiative in line with the Thailand 4.0 initiative) and to promote sustainable management of agricultural resources. In that last category, the government sets targets around the increase of certain types of farmland to promote a more sustainable revival and conservation of agricultural resources. While there are no specific targets for reducing GHG emissions in the agriculture sector, the Thai Rice NAMA (2018–2023) aims to reduce emissions from rice production by 26% over those five years (Nama Facility, no date).\n",
    "An important development in the agriculture sector is related to biofuels. The production of cassava, sugar and palm has increased in Thailand, leading to an increase in utilised acreage (Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, 2017). Part of the crops is used for the production of biofuels, which some report suggest could lead to lower emissions in Thailand compared to their fossil fuel counterparts (e.g. Lecksiwilai et al., 2017). In the absence of sustainability standards for biofuels, the benefits of using biofuels could be outweighed by issues related to unsustainable land use, deforestation or the use of pesticides (Silalertruksa and Gheewala, 2012; Lecksiwilai and Gheewala, 2020).\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "The buildings sector represented 20.9% of final energy consumption in 2018, split between 7.8% for the commercial and 13.1% for the residential sector (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020b). The government has since taken measures to bring down emissions from the buildings sector, both in the residential and commercial and public buildings.\n",
    "Under the Energy Efficiency Development Plan (EEDP) (2015), the government identifies the need for buildings and appliances to be more energy efficient. It sets an energy consumption reduction target of 4,819 ktoe by 2036 in the commercial and public buildings sector, with an additional reduction of 2,153 ktoe in the residential sector (APERC, 2017). The target to reduce the energy demand in new buildings by 36% is included under the compulsory programme designed under the EEP. The AEDP (2015) contains a target for heat generated by renewables of 30–35% 2036. Three solar technologies (solar water heater, solar dryer and solar cooling) have also been promoted heavily in the plan (Misila, Winyuchakrit and Limmeechokchai, 2020).\n",
    "The Building Energy Codes (BEC), adopted in 2009, aimed at improving energy efficiency for new or retrofitted buildings larger than 2000 m2, through better design of a building’s envelope, and its lighting, cooling and heating systems (APERC, 2017). It will be extended to a wider array of buildings while promoting the construction of energy-efficient buildings respecting certain certificates (such as LEED and TREES); it will also promote Zero-Energy Building (ZEBs) for new private and government constructions. For public buildings, it proposes that Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) will provide energy performance contracts and ensure energy savings (Ministry of Energy, 2017).\n",
    "Further emission reduction measures include appliance standards. In 2011, the government adopted Minimum Energy and High Energy Performance Standards (MEPS/HEPS). It created mandatory MEPS to limit the energy consumption in air conditioners, refrigerators, and certain types of fluorescent lamps, while 28 appliances were covered by newly established HEPS (APERC, 2017). Considering the importance of refrigeration and air conditioning in Thailand’s buildings sector – due to hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions with a high global warming potential– the government has implemented the ‘Refrigeration and Air Conditioning NAMA (RAC NAMA)’ to promote the production of climate-friendly and energy-efficient technologies. RAC equipment is expected to cut emissions by 19.4 MtCO2e over its lifetime (NAMA facility, no date).\n",
    "\n## Waste\n",
    "The waste sector represented 8.5% (approx. 30 MtCO2e) of GHG emissions in 2021, excluding LULUCF (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022). Thailand generated 26.9 million tonnes of municipal solid waste in 2015, of which only 31% were appropriately disposed of. In addition, 3.4 million tonnes of hazardous waste were produced, of which only 35% were properly disposed of (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2020a). Wastewater treatment facilities have also been insufficient; the government noted that in 2013, of the 14 million m3/day of wastewater, only 3.2 million could be treated (Chokewinyoo and Khanayai, 2013). The lack of waste treatment is an important issue, as the national GHG inventory showed that 90% of total emissions from the waste sector came from methane emanating from landfills and wastewater in 2013 (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2020a).\n",
    "To address these waste issues, the government has adopted a number of policies. The National Solid Waste Management Master Plan (2016–2021) contains four important measures: 1) reduce waste generation and improve waste collection by applying the “3Rs” (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) waste management principle, and improve the efficiency of waste separation to reduce disposal of waste; 2) increase waste recovery and disposal by introducing integrated technologies such as waste-to-energy systems; 3) improve the legal framework surrounding waste management and 4) encourage public involvement by promoting education, awareness campaigns and capacity building (Wichai-utcha and Chavalparit, 2019).\n",
    "Projects aiming at collecting landfill gas to produce electricity have also been launched. In Bangkok for example, the Kamphaeng Saen Landfill was equipped with a landfill gas collection system and is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 78,209 tCO2e/year (UNFCCC, no date).\n",
    "\n## Forestry\n",
    "Thailand recorded a large LULUCF sink in its latest inventory equivalent to around 20% of its emissions. Thailand should work toward maintaining this sink.\n",
    "Thailand’s terrain is divided between 47% of agricultural land use, 21% of non-agricultural land use and 32% of forest areas (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2020a). The country has lost over 2 Mha of forest cover since 2001, despite the nationwide logging ban adopted in January 1989, prompting a new series of laws against deforestation (Global Forest Watch, no date).\n",
    "The National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017–2021) targeted forest reserves to be expanded up to 40% of the national territory, with an expansion of conservation areas to at least 25%, and an annual mangrove coastal reforestation of at least 10,000 hectares, all improvements from the previous Plan in 2012 (NESDB, 2017).\n",
    "With the revision of the 20-Year National Strategy in 2018, the government stated it will increase forest areas to 55% of the country’s land by 2037 (Bangkok Post, 2018). According to the official inventory, Thailand’s forestry sector has been a net carbon sink since 2000 (when records start). The country’s increasing progressiveness of forestry policy in the last 20 years has also been reflected in the ongoing trend of an increasing forestry carbon sink (47% net increase in carbon sink from 2000 to 2016).\n",
    "In 2016, Thailand received a grant from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility to develop and implement activities to increase REDD+ readiness. The project was implemented between 2016 and 2019 and led to the publication of Thailand’s forest reference emissions level and forest reference level for REDD+ under the UNFCCC (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020a).\n",
    "In Thailand’s LT-LEDS, it expects to reach a level LULUCF removals of 120 MtCO2e by 2037, staying at the same amount until 2050 (ONEP, 2022).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "To first establish historical emissions from 1990–2000, data excl. the LULUCF sector for 1994 and 2000 was obtained from Thailand’s Second Biennial Update Report (BUR2), with emissions interpolated in between (ONEP, 2017). Historical emissions from 1990 to 1994 were extrapolated backwards based on emission trends. The time series was harmonized to Thailand’s Third Biennial Update Report (BUR3), in AR4 GWPs, by applying emissions growth rates backwards from the BUR3’s earliest inventory year (2000) to the base year of 1990 (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020b). Historical emissions data from 2000–2016 were taken from the BUR3. From 2016 to 2021, all GHGs follow the growth rates of PRIMAP-hist national historical emissions time series (Gütschow and Pflüger, 2022).\n",
    "\n## NDC and other targets\n",
    "Thailand’s 2020 NAMA targets, 7–20% under business-as-usual (BAU) (applying to the energy and transport sector) are quantified (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2014). As there is no BAU published for 2020, we calculate the value in 2020 based on reports from BUR3 that the country had achieved a 15.76% GHG emission reduction from BAU as of 2018 (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020b). Based on our calculations, the BAU for 2020 was set at 469 MtCO2e/year excl. LULUCF, implying 2020 emission level targets of between 375 to 436 MtCO2e/year. According to our analysis, Thailand overachieved the range of its targets with emission levels at 342 MtCO2e/year in 2020, largely due to the economic down-turn caused by COVID-19. Prior to COVID-19, Thailand was on track to be safely within the range.\n",
    "The Second NDC targets for 2030 consists of a 30% unconditional and 40% conditional target in emissions reduction under BAU (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2022). The targets exclude emissions from LULUCF. As noted in Thailand’s NDC submission, the BAU for 2030 was set at 555 MtCO2e/year excluding LULUCF, implying unconditional and conditional targets of 389 and 333 MtCO2e/year respectively.\n",
    "Thailand’s LT-LEDS (revised) we build the emissions pathway from 2030 to 2065 based on modelling results from ONEP and confirmed in the official document. Data points include CO2 and GHG emissions over five-year timesteps. The level of LULUCF sinks are also extracted from documents along the same time series, stabilising at -120 MtCO2/yr after 2037 (ONEP, 2022). As the CAT excludes LULUCF (see explanation), we calculate GHG emission levels at five year timesteps from 2030 to 2065 by subtracting LULUCF sinks from net GHGs. We linearly interpolate emission levels between the timesteps as data is not available on an annual resolution.\n",
    "\n## Policies and action projections\n",
    "Thailand’s current policy projections (CPP) uses APEC Energy Outlook (2019) BAU scenario (includes current policies) to establish historical (from 2015) and projected data (to 2035) for electricity generation and final energy consumption by fuel as well as total economy-wide emissions (excl. LULUCF). Electricity generation shares by fuel for 2020 is adjusted to the latest updated statistics from BP (2020) and Ember (Ember, 2021) as APEC’s historical data is outdated. Final energy consumption is not adjusted to other sources, such as BP (2020) and official statistics from the Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) and Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) due to large differences in inventory and accounting methods (EPPO, 2021). As a sensitivity check, 2020 values were cross-referenced with historical data from the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) from the Ministry of Energy (MoE), which are closely matched (e.g. Ministry of Energy, 2019b). Values were extrapolated with 5-year historical trends to 2037 to compare numbers with Thailand’s long-term energy planning horizon.\n",
    "Electricity emission factors for fossil fuels use IEA’s World Energy Outlook for Southeast Asia (2019), given no better sources and EGAT’s historical statistics does not include technology breakdowns for Independent, Small, and Very Small power producers. Factors for 2020 are assumed to be the same as those for 2025 since Thailand’s emission intensity should be better than the regional average. Factors for 2037 are assumed to be the same as 2035.\n",
    "\n## Planned policy projections\n",
    "Thailand’s planned policy projections (PPP) follow the Power Development Plan (PDP) and Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), with the following share targets to be achieved in 2037 (Ministry of Energy, 2019c, 2019a):\n",
    "- Generation",
    "- Energy consumption",
    "For generation, the PPP matches the CPP for all historical years until 2020 before specific fuel shares are expected to reach their targets linearly to 2037. Total generation from the power sector also matches CPP. Compared to the CPP, the PPP projects lower electricity generation for fossil fuel sources and also a larger reliance on gas compared to coal. For end-use sector consumption, historical data and projected total energy consumption data is also matched to the CPP, while we assume renewable energy share targets are reached linearly to 2037. The mix of fuel shares for fossil fuels are assumed to mirror the mix of the CPP over time. Overall, fossil fuel shares in energy consumption are lower than the CPP by 13% due to the large renewables target.\n",
    "The PPP uses the same methodology for electricity emission factors as the CPP to quantify emissions. The policies used for the PPP are already in force; however, energy sector transformation has yet to be realised. In addition, new unconfirmed high-level strategies, such as the National Energy Plan, may come with a revision of the PDP and AEDP. The COVID-pandemic aftermath and global energy crisis are also affecting the speed of energy transition in recent years. Until there is more certainty on these policies, the PDP and AEDP 2018 will stay as Thailand’s PPP pathway instead of the CPP.\n",
    "\n## COVID-19 impact\n",
    "We applied a novel method to estimate the COVID-19 related dip in greenhouse gas emissions until 2030. The uncertainty surrounding the severity and length of the pandemic creates a new level of uncertainty for current and future greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
    "We take 2021 as the last historical data point and for emissions between 2022 and 2030, we first update the current and planned policy projections using the most recent projections, usually prepared before the pandemic. We then distil the emission intensity (GHG emissions/GDP) from this pre-pandemic scenario and apply to it most recent GDP projections that take into account the effect of the pandemic. To capture potential differentiated effects of COVID-19 on the economy, the lower bound of the current and planned projects capture the effects if COVID continues its impacts on the entire economy, while the upper bound captures the impacts of COVID-19 only on the energy and industry sectors (which consist of the significant majority of Thailand’s CO2 emissions), assuming the agriculture and waste sectors are unaffected. The GDP projections from Thailand’s NESDC (2022) of 2.7% for 2022 were used to create the lower bound of our policy projections while the Board of Investment’s (2022) projection of 3.3% was the most optimistic estimate, creating the upper bound. For 2023, the lower bound uses the Board of Investment’s 4.2% estimate while the upper bound uses the Asian Development Bank’s 4.5% (2022). The forecast going forward relies on IMF (2021) projections until 2027.\n",
    "\n## Global Warming Potentials values\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series. Assessments completed prior to December 2018 (COP24) used GWP values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR).\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "Thailand submitted its second NDC target to the UNFCCC on November 2, 2022 (Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, 2022). The second NDC includes revised unconditional and conditional targets, both of which has been strengthened. Additionally, the new NDC has included reference to Thailand’s revision of its long-term target.\n",
    "The remaining critical elements of the NDC remains the same as its previously updated NDC in 2020. The NDC still covers economy-wide emissions excluding LULUCF, covers all greenhouse gases except NF3, has omitted explanation of why the target is a fair contribution, and maintains the same target formulation of emission reductions under business-as-usual.\n",
    "In order to receive a 1.5°C compatible rating for its climate targets, Thailand would need to do the following:\n",
    "- Submit a conditional NDC target to reduce emissions by approximately 44% by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, or 65% reduction under its stated BAU.",
    "- Submit an unconditional NDC target to reduce emissions by approximately 31% by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, or 57% reduction under its stated BAU.",
    "\n## NDC Updates\n",
    "Thailand’s second NDC, submitted on November 2, 2022, is an improvement on its updated NDC submitted in 2020 through strengthened emission reduction targets, although several elements can still be improved.\n",
    "The second NDC’s overall targets include its unconditional GHG reduction target of 30% (up from 20%) and a conditional target of 40% (up from 25%) below BAU level by 2030, excluding LULUCF. Thailand has included a reference to its LT-LEDS revision, which aims for carbon neutrality by 2050 and net zero GHGs by 2065, although the alignment of the mid-term and long-term targets remain unclear from the NDC.\n",
    "The document has several elements which could still be improved to increase the transparency of its targets. Like the previous submission, the NDC provides no details on sectoral targets, although it has indicated forthcoming implementation plans such as the NDC Roadmap on Mitigation and Sectoral NDC plans, does not explain why its targets are a fair contribution, and does not yet cover all GHGs (missing NF3). Furthermore, Thailand has kept the same BAU emissions level of 555 MtCO2e by 2030 (the same as in the first NDC and updated NDC). The BAU should be updated, especially in the light of the global pandemic and energy crisis of recent years. The best practice revision to this target type, would be to submit an absolute emissions target.\n",
    "The document notes it intends to achieve its unconditional target through domestic efforts, but continues to explore the potential of international market-based cooperation, which could include the use of Article 6 mechanisms. Thailand has not included LULUCF within the scope of the NDC but highlights its domestic actions in forestry. Thailand’s exclusion of LULUCF from its NDC target is welcome, given it improves transparency in the target and highlights the need for action in other sectors (LULUCF in Thailand is historically a carbon sink) A separate target for LULUCF would further strengthen the NDC.\n",
    "The CAT calculates that the unconditional target would lead to an emissions level of 389 MtCO2e (a 13% improvement from its previous NDC) by 2030 excluding LULUCF, while the conditional target would lead to 333 MtCO2e (a 20% improvement from previous), excluding LULUCF. To achieve its conditional target, Thailand indicates that it would require adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer, financial resources and capacity building support. The CAT rating for Thailand’s unconditional target remains the same at “Critically insufficient”, although a slight increase in ambition would raise the target to the next rating. The CAT’s rating for Thailand’s conditional target has improved to “Insufficient”.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.\n",
    "N/A\n",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against what needs to happen within a country’s own borders.\n",
    "Thailand has put forward two targets in its NDC. One that it will achieve using its own resources and one that requires international support. We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution (‘Unconditional NDC target against fair share’) and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its border (‘conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways’).\n",
    "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s 2030 conditional target as “Insufficient”. The “Insufficient” rating indicates that Thailand’s conditional NDC target in 2030 is not yet consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit, and is associated with a 3 °C-compatible trajectory, when compared to modelled domestic pathways.\n",
    "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
    "We rate Thailand’s unconditional NDC target “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share. Thailand’s unconditional targets remain based on an inflated BAU that is significantly higher than its current and planned policy projections, even before the onset of COVID-19. Economic trends post-pandemic now lends even more weight to the possibility that the BAU is unrealistic and should be revised downward, with a corresponding strengthening of its emissions reduction targets. If all countries were to follow Thailand’s current approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against Modelled domestic pathways and Fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "Thailand submitted its revised Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy on 7 November, 2022, which moved the ‘carbon neutrality’ target forward to 2050 and committed to ‘net zero’ emissions by 2065 (ONEP, 2022). This represents an accelerated target from its original ‘carbon neutrality’ target for 2065 submitted to the UNFCCC in October 2021 (Thailand Government, 2021).\n",
    "We evaluate the net zero target as: **Average.** For details on the analysis, see the Net zero tab.\n",
    "\n## 2020 pledge\n",
    "The target of a GHG emissions reduction of 7–20% below BAU in the energy and transport sectors had been included in Thailand’s NAMAs and Climate Change Master Plan (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2014, 2015). The measures included mitigation actions in the energy and transport sectors.\n",
    "The 3rd Biennial Update Report notes that in 2018, Thailand had achieved a GHG emissions reduction of 15.76% under its BAU (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020b). The CAT calculates Thailand’s 2020 BAU reference to be 470 MtCO2e and its GHG emissions reduction targets to be around 375 to 435 MtCO2e/year in 2020. According to CAT analysis, Thailand overachieved this goal due to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, although it was on track to be within the range pre-COVID as well.\n",
