    "# Summary",
    "\n## Overview\n",
    "**Viet Nam is seeing growing momentum for renewable energy integration and coal phase-out, aligning with its commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Yet these initiatives are currently impeded by the country's dependence on coal beyond 2030 and the government's plan to increase use of fossil gas as a “transition fuel”. The increasing imports of coal and gas raise concerns about energy security, despite the pursuit of cleaner energy sources.**\n",
    "**While there has been significant momentum in the deployment of renewable energy in recent years, the targets for solar and wind energy rollout in the government’s plans are still insufficient. The modest growth in ambition for reducing power generation emissions fails to offset the absence of policies aimed at addressing emissions from other sectors of the economy, where efforts remain lacklustre. The CAT’s overall rating of Viet Nam’s climate targets and action remains “Critically insufficient”.**\n",
    "In December 2022, Viet Nam joined the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) to achieve its net-zero commitment by 2050, initially receiving USD 15.5bn until 2026-2028. The partnership strives to achieve a power sector emissions peak of 170 MtCO2e by 2030 while aiming for a 47% renewable energy share by the same year.\n",
    "However, the JETP's focus on coal elimination inadvertently promotes fossil gas, a key component of Viet Nam’s latest Power Development Plan. Worries are also emerging over the partnership’s loan-heavy financing approach, which has the potential to impose debt burdens on a developing nation like Viet Nam. The full and substantial implementation of the JETP may result in additional reductions of 4-18% in emissions below current policies scenario by 2030.\n",
    "Following the signing of the JETP, Viet Nam adopted the long-awaited Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8) in May 2023, sending mixed signals to Viet Nam’s power sector. While scaling down its earlier coal expansion plans and emphasising the integration of renewable energy, Viet Nam is concurrently strengthening its reliance on fossil gas for power generation, expanding gas infrastructure, and introducing LNG imports. However, gas is not a transition fuel - the IEA's latest Net Zero Emissions Scenario is clear that power generation from natural gas must drops by 98% between 2022 and 2050.\n",
    "Viet Nam is facing severe climate change-induced droughts, with disruptions in hydropower generation and over-reliance on coal-fired generation ultimately leading to extensive power shortages.\n",
    "Viet Nam’s emissions are set to keep rising until 2030, contrary to what is needed to achieve the 1.5°C temperature goal. To reverse this trend, Viet Nam could:\n",
    "- **Expedite the phase-out of coal power**, by developing an effective retirement plan of the existing coal power plants more ambitious than the plans in the JETP, and issuing more detailed rules regarding the reconversion of the existing fleet.",
    "- **Avoid relying on gas as a “transition fuel”** to increase energy security, affordability, and profit from the multiple co-benefits coming with the phase-out of fossil fuels and avoid potential emissions lock-in.",
    "- **Enable a swift rollout of renewable energy sources through investments in the grid.** When supported by adequate power transmission and distribution infrastructure, these solutions already offer greater affordability compared to investing in fossil fuel projects. Viet Nam benefits from a substantial wind and solar energy potential.",
    "- **Address emissions from the agriculture and industry sectors**, which accounted respectively for 18% and 17% of the Viet Nam’s emissions. The current lack of policy directions leaves the emissions from these two sectors unchecked.",
    "Despite these drawbacks, the latest developments include some positive developments:\n",
    "- **Coal power generation now has a phase-out timeline of 2050**, although it lacks specific details. This timeline completes Viet Nam's commitment made at COP26, where it pledged to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation and cease the construction of new coal plants.",
    "- **The pipeline of coal projects has shrunk significantly**, decreasing the risks of fossil fuel lock-in.",
    "- **The JETP and its inclusion in the government's power development plan can act as catalysts** for the renewable power sources rollout by channelling investments towards the energy transition.",
    "The CAT rates Viet Nam’s climate targets and policies as “Critically insufficient”. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s climate policies and commitments are not consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature limit. Viet Nam’s 2030 emissions reduction target is consistent with more than 4°C of warming when compared with modelled domestic pathways and the extent of reductions that need to be taking place inside its borders.\n",
    "Viet Nam updated its NDC targets in 2022 without increasing ambition. Its updated NDC strengthened its targets on paper, but will not drive real-world emission reductions beyond its current level of climate action. The CAT rates these updated targets as “Critically insufficient” against both modelled domestic pathways and what a fair contribution for Viet Nam would be. Viet Nam’s current policies result in emissions levels lower than its targets, but are still “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam needs to set more ambitious targets for emissions reductions and implement the associated policies to get a better rating.\n",
    "The CAT rates Viet Nam’s climate policies and action as “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution. Under Viet Nam’s current policies and action, emissions will continue to rise to around 592-692 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 and are consistent with more than 4°C warming. Under a fair contribution for 1.5°C emissions would roughly stabilise at today’s level, at about 350 MtCO2e in 2030.\n",
    "In May 2023, the Viet Nam government adopted the final version of the Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8). In this plan Viet Nam has highlighted the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the PDP8 is centred around growing dependence on fossil gas and LNG is put forward as “transition fuel” towards net zero.\n",
    "Coal usage for power generation remains a concern for Viet Nam, although showing notable recent decline in pipeline largely due to insufficient project financing. The PDP8 aims to eliminate coal capacity by 2050, though coal will persist in the energy mix through this decade, contributing around 20% of installed capacity by 2030, an improvement on the 2021 figure of 30%. This updated target marks a significant enhancement over the previous PDP7 goal.\n",
    "Viet Nam is planning to increase both domestic production and import of coal for power generation. The ratio of domestically produced to imported coal will decline to 36-39% in 2030 from 46% in 2021. An increased reliance on coal imports will worsen Viet Nam’s energy security and make it more vulnerable to price volatility.\n",
    "Adoption of the PDP8 confirms the scale up of fossil gas power generation, and its prioritisation over renewable energy rollout in Viet Nam. Fossil gas-based power generation capacity will be 25% in 2030. To support this expansion of gas-based power generation, Viet Nam is planning to increase domestic production of gas as well as import, further increasing vulnerability to energy security threats in a complex geopolitical landscape.\n",
    "The plan proposes a share of renewable generation of 31-39% by 2030, and 47% in case of a “full and substantial” implementation of the JETP by international partners. The Master Plan for National Energy sets an energy-related greenhouse gas emissions target of 399-449 MtCO2e by 2030, compared to 259 MtCO2e in 2021.\n",
    "**The full policies and action analysis can be found** **here** **.**\n",
    "We rate Viet Nam’s 2030 conditional target against a 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway as “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam’s conditional target equates to 620 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF).\n",
    "Viet Nam can achieve this target without any additional effort beyond current policies and action, which we estimated to be 592-692 MtCO2e by 2030. Viet Nam would need to reduce the emissions level of the current policies and actions trajectory by 40-49% (353 MtCO2e) by 2030 to be in line with 1.5°C. Substantial improvement is needed in this target.\n",
    "Viet Nam’s unconditional target equates to 863 MtCO2e by 2030 (excluding LULUCF), which we rate as “Critically insufficient”. Viet Nam will achieve this target without any additional effort beyond current policies and actions. Viet Nam would need to reduce the current policies and action pathway by 41-49% (to 350 MtCO2e) to be in line with a 1.5°C fair share pathway.\n",
    "Viet Nam updated its Paris Agreement target in November 2022. The target was 39 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) stronger than the previous NDC, and the transparency and sectoral coverage have improved. Yet, the target does not drive real climate action as it will be easily overachieved with current policies and action. Both Viet Nam’s NDC targets are consistent with a warming of over 4°C: if all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "In 2016, Viet Nam had a net carbon sink capacity of 39 MtCO2e. In its National Climate Change Strategy to 2050, Viet Nam has established a target for its land use and forestry sector with the aim of reducing 70% of remaining emissions, thereby increase the carbon absorption rate by 20% and achieving a total sink capacity of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. It will aim to maintain national forest coverage of 43%, by improving forest quality and sustainable forest management techniques, and is critical to achieve net zero for Viet Nam.\n",
    "Viet Nam announced a target to achieve net zero by 2050 during the COP26 World Leaders’ Summit in 2021. In July 2022, Viet Nam reiterated its commitment to reach net zero in the decision approving its National Climate Change Strategy, aimed at guiding its planning to achieve net zero by 2050. Viet Nam’s net zero target is conditional on international financial support. The CAT rates Viet Nam’s target as “Average”.\n",

    "# Net zero targets",
    "\n## Summary\n",
    "CAT rates Viet Nam’s net zero target as \"**Average**”.\n",
    "Viet Nam announced its target to achieve net zero by 2050 target during the COP26 World Leaders' Summit in 2021. In July 2022, Viet Nam included its net-zero target in Prime Minister’s Decision No.896/QD-TTg approving the National Climate Change Strategy, which aims at guiding Viet Nam’s climate action through 2050. While Prime Minister's decisions are legal documents, Viet Nam has yet to formalise the target in the legislation. Viet Nam's net zero target relies on international financial support.\n",
    "Viet Nam has signed the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with an international coalition of donors, which specifically cites the aim of assisting Viet Nam in its pursuit of achieving its net zero target by 2050 with a focus on transition away from coal, not all fossil fuels (European Commission, 2022a).\n",
    "In the National Climate Change Strategy, the government sets a cap on total emissions of 185 MtCO2e in 2050. The emissions cap is divided between the energy (101 MtCO2e), industry (20 MtCO2e), agriculture (56 MtCO2e), and waste (8 MtCO2e) sectors. The strategy aims at compensating for the remaining emissions with removals from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector and an increase in carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector.\n",
    "The National Climate Change Strategy calls for a gradual transition from coal-fired electricity to cleaner energy sources, reducing the share of fossil fuel energy sources, not developing new coal-fired power projects after 2030, while gradually reducing coal power capacity after 2035.\n",
    "Improving energy efficiency is also emphasised in this strategy by increasing the share of energy efficient equipment in use within the industrial, residential and agricultural sectors, including the reduction of fuel use from the electrification of agricultural machinery in the post-harvest agricultural production chain.\n",
    "In its most recent power sector development plan (PDP8), Viet Nam has highlighted the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the PDP8 is centred around a growing dependence on fossil gas and LNG is put forward as a “transition fuel” towards net zero. The rising reliance on fossil gas in the planned power sector expansion increases the country's risk of stranded assets. The Master Plan for National Energy, published a few weeks after the PDP8, includes targets for carbon capture and storage.\n",

    "\n## Ten key elements\n",
    "**Scope**\n",
    "- **Target year** – Viet Nam aims to reach net zero by 2050.",
    "- **Emissions coverage** – Viet Nam’s net zero target covers the three main GHG emissions, i.e. CO2 (72% of total GHG emissions in 2021), CH4 (21%), N2O (5%) as these are the relevant gases in Viet Nam. Emissions of F-gases are negligible. HFCs account for <1% (Gütschow et al., 2022a; Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2020).",
    "- **International aviation and shipping** – Viet Nam does not provide information on international aviation and shipping in its targets.",
    "- **Reductions or removals outside of own borders** – Viet Nam does not provide information on its intention to use international offset credits to meet its net zero target by 2050.",
    "**Target architecture**\n",
    "- **Legal status** – The 2050 National Climate Change Strategy has been formalised through a decision issued by the Prime Minister (a legal instrument), but is not yet incorporated into legislation (Viet Nam Government, 2022d). The net zero target has become a core element of multiple subsequent policy documents, including the PDP8 and the 2022 NDC (Viet Nam Government, 2022a). Viet Nam has not yet submitted a long term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategy (LT-LEDS) to the UNFCCC.",
    "- **Separate reduction & removal targets** – In its National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam aims to reduce emissions from the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector by 90% in 2050 relative to the BAU level. In addition, Viet Nam intends to increase carbon sequestration by 30% relative to the BAU level. The combination of actions in the LULUCF and carbon sequestration sectors are expected to provide a 185 MtCO2e sink.In the National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam sets a target to maintain forest coverage at 43% along with ensuring area of national forest, improve forest quality and sustainable forest management (Viet Nam Government, 2022).",
    "- **Review process** – In the National Climate Change Strategy, there are provisions for reviewing and updating national strategies, as well as planning for a 5-year and 10-year period. The review process seeks to balance socio-economic development plans with Viet Nam’s net zero goals, and the Ministry of Planning and Investment will oversee this.",
    "**Transparency**\n",
    "- **Carbon dioxide removal** – Viet Nam has a target to increase its carbon sequestration capacity by 30% compared to its BAU, which is expected to realise a 185 MtCO2e of carbon sink capacity in 2050 when combined with actions in the LULUCF sector. However, transparent assumptions for other removals and storage, in particular technological solutions, are still lacking.",
    "- **Comprehensive planning** – In its National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam provides detailed sectoral emissions reductions targets for energy, industrial process, agriculture and waste, as well as the LULUCF sector along with sector specific key action areas. This strategy also provides an interim target in 2030 of 36% reduction from BAU level of emissions (excluding LULUCF) in 2030 (977 MtCO2e) and emissions peaking by 2035. The strategy states that Viet Nam will not develop new coal-fired power plants after 2030, and it will gradually reduce its coal fleet after 2035. However, according to the PDP8, the power sector will still depend extensively on fossil fuels until at least 2030, and substantial new gas infrastructure are being developed. The prospects for phasing out the fossil fuel fleet are uncertain and depend on vague plans to convert existing plants to alternative fuels (Viet Nam Government, 2023a). The Master Plan on National Energy includes the target to reach a CO2 capture capacity of 1 MtCO2 by 2040, and 3 to 6 MtCO2 by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023b).",
    "- **Clarity on fairness of target** – Viet Nam provides no information on its intention to explain the target’s fairness.",
    "\n## Good practice\n",
    "The Climate Action Tracker has defined the following good practice for all ten key elements of net zero targets. Countries can refer to this good practice to design or enhance their net zero targets.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# 2035 NDC",
    "\n## 2035 NDC Target\n",
    "Viet Nam has not yet submitted their 2035 NDC to the UNFCCC. Once the new NDC has been submitted, we will publish our assessment here.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Policies & action",
    "Viet Nam’s current policies and action are rated “Critically insufficient” when compared to its fair share contribution. The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s policies and action in 2030 reflect minimal to no action and are not at all consistent with the 1.5°C temperature limit. If all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "Viet Nam’s emissions under current policies will reach around 592-692 MtCO2e in 2030 (excl. LULUCF) whereas a 1.5˚C fair share pathway is 350 MtCO2e in 2030.\n",
    "If Viet Nam receives all the international support committed under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), it would go some way to closing the gap, but further action is needed. This is represented under the planned policy scenario where emissions could reach up to 568 MtCO2e by 2030.\n",
    "**Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****.**\n",
    "\n## Policy overview\n",
    "The CAT estimates that Viet Nam's emissions, excluding LULUCF, will range from 592 to 692 MtCO2e in 2030 under current policies. This estimate reflects a reduction of 0 to 10 MtCO2e compared to our assessment from last year, mainly due to lower historical emissions than previously estimated. Emissions in 2030 are projected to be 37 to 60% higher than the emissions in 2021.\n",
    "The architecture of Viet Nam’s climate action framework to 2050 is articulated in the National Climate Change Strategy to 2050, setting the goal of reaching net zero by 2050. Since COP27, important policy documents covering the energy sector have emerged, including the long-awaited Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8) and the Master Plan for National Energy, building on the foundations of the Climate Change Strategy. In December 2022, Viet Nam signed the Just Energy Transition Partner (JETP), which comes as a policy support for achieving the goal outlined in PDP8.\n",
    "Earlier National Energy Development Strategy (Resolution no. 55) was issued to support renewable energy uptake and law on Environmental Protection provided the legal framework for domestic carbon market. Energy efficiency is addressed through the Viet Nam National Energy Efficiency Program 3 (2019-2030), with a legislated target of reducing total final energy consumption.\n",
    "Viet Nam's energy landscape is undergoing a transformation as the country works to reduce its reliance on coal. This includes the expansion of renewable energy sources, their integration into the energy grid, and a determined push to phase out coal power by 2050. Nevertheless, the government is considering fossil gas as a “transition fuel” and is actively working to expand fossil fuel import infrastructure. Rapid historical and planned growth in coal and gas imports pose energy security concerns.\n",
    "**Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)**In December 2022, Viet Nam joined the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). This partnership will provide USD 15.5bn in support until 2026-2028, from a group of donor countries to help Viet Nam reach its net zero commitment by 2050. The JETP Resources Mobilization Plan detailing the conditions of the partnership is expected to be released in November 2023.\n",
    "Key elements of the agreement include the peaking of power sector emissions in Viet Nam at 170 MtCO2e in 2030, and a targeted share of 47% of renewable energy generation by the end of the decade. The JETP aims at bringing forward Viet Nam’s peak emissions target from 2035 to 2030. The agreement also includes a biennial revision of the targets. The ambition and goals of the JETP are reflected in the PDP8, discussed below.\n",
    "The JETP primarily aims to gradually eliminate coal from power generation. This involves re-skilling programs, halting investments in coal power plants, and initiating discussions for closing unabated coal-fired facilities. However, the JETP's tunnel vision towards coal might inadvertently facilitate the substitution of coal with other fossil fuels, which contradicts its climate action objectives. This manifests as an emphasis on fossil gas-based power generation in PDP8, which will increase drastically over the rest of this decade.\n",
    "As the modalities of the South African and Indonesian JETPs are becoming more precise, concerns are arising regarding the share of loans in the financial packages (Australian Institute of International Affairs, 2023). The delivery of financing through concessional and commercial loans, instead of grants and other financial instruments, can aggravate the debt burden of developing nations, potentially generating debt traps.\n",
    "The JETP agreement clearly emphasises the necessity of engaging in \"regular consultation\" with media, non-governmental organisations, and other stakeholders to ensure a wide-reaching social consensus. Nonetheless, the recent upsurge in detentions and arrests of environmental activists in the country appears to contradict the principles of justice and equity that are fundamental to this agreement (Le Monde, 2023; The Washington Post, 2023).\n",
    "**Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8)**The long-awaited Power Development Plan 8 (PDP8), adopted in May 2023, sets out the planning of the power sector for the rest of the decade. The plan defines numerous targets for 2030 and 2050, taking into consideration Viet Nam's abundant renewable energy potential. It emphasises the need to modernise power sector infrastructure, enhance electricity generation, and support the country in achieving its 2050 net zero goals.\n",
    "The plan aims at reducing coal generation from 114 TWh in 2021 to zero by 2050. In the PDP8, Viet Nam's coal capacity target for the year 2030 stands at slightly over 30 GW (20% of the capacity mix), compared to 23 GW in 2021 (30% of the capacity mix). This is a significant reduction from the previous target of the PDP7 and the 2022 draft PDP8.\n",
    "The PDP8 renewable targets lack ambition, and the rollout of solar and wind is planned to occur at a much slower rate than during the last few years. Renewable energy will account for 31 to 39% of the power generation mix in 2030 (including hydro), and 47% in the case of a full and substantial implementation of the JETP, compared to 43% in 2021. The share of non-hydro renewable energy capacity is planned to remain at current levels of 28% by 2030. However, the overall installed capacity is set to increase to 43 GW by 2030, up from current levels of 21 GW.\n",
    "Viet Nam plans to lean heavily on fossil gas as a transition fuel. The share of fossil gas in the power generation mix is set to increase significantly, with capacity rising to 37 GW by 2030 compared to 8 GW in 2021. The 2030 target includes 22 GW of LNG power plants, marking the start of LNG imports in Viet Nam.\n",
    "The PDP8 defines additional 2030 emissions and renewable penetration targets contingent on the “full and substantial” implementation of the JETP, that would further accelerate the transition to a clean energy system. Power sector emissions with support from the JETP are included under the Planned Policy scenario. A successful implementation of the JETP would lead to a 4% to 18% reduction in Viet Nam's total emissions compared to the emissions under current policies.\n",
    "Integrating a high share of variable renewable energy will require upgrading the country's electricity grid. The lack of planning in transmission and distribution has resulted in severe grid failures, leading to a pause on new renewable capacity deployments in 2022. Variable renewable energy deployment has been concentrated in the centre and south of the country. To fully utilise its potential and reduce curtailments, Viet Nam will need to support the growth of its energy storage infrastructure through regulatory mechanisms, continuous development of infrastructure, and potential connections with other countries. The ongoing transformation of Viet Nam’s power market can lift the barriers obstructing investments towards clean energy sources.\n",
    "Designed with an annual GDP growth aligned with historical expansion of around 7% until 2050, putting PDP8 into action will require investments estimated at USD 135bn by 2030 to achieve this target.\n",
    "**Master Plan on National Energy (2021-2030)**The Master Plan on National Energy for the period 2021-2030 integrates the PDP8 into a broader roadmap for the energy sector, aimed at reaching Viet Nam’s development goals while meeting its net zero target by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023b). It sets an energy-related GHG emissions target of 399-449 MtCO2e by 2030, (51-73% above 2021 levels) and 101 MtCO2e by 2050 (62% below 2021 levels).\n",
    "Like the PDP8, the National Energy Plan places a significant emphasis on fossil fuels, with clean energy taking a back seat. The plan outlines targets for coal, gas, and oil production. Domestic coal production will remain prominent until mid-century, while coal imports are projected to peak in 2035 before being phased out by 2050. Despite this focus on fossil fuel development, the share of renewable energy in the total energy supply is expected to increase only marginally.\n",
    "The Energy Master Plan takes into account the production of alternative fuels through the establishment of targeted metrics for biofuels, biogas, synthetic fuels, and technology-neutral hydrogen production.\n",
    "In contrast to the PDP8, which mentions carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) qualitatively, the Master Plan lays out a more comprehensive plan for its expansion. By 2040, the goal is to reach a capture capacity of 1 MtCO2 through the implementation of this technology, with an eye towards potential future expansion to 3 to 6 MtCO2 by 2050.\n",
    "The Master Plan on National Energy estimates capital investments for the energy sector at USD 630-813bn for the period 2021-2050, including USD 173-202bn for the period 2021-2030.\n",
    "\n## Sectoral pledges\n",
    "In Glasgow, several sectoral initiatives were launched to accelerate climate action on methane, the coal exit, 100% EVs and forests. At most, these initiatives may close the 2030 emissions gap by around 9% - or 2.2 GtCO2e, though assessing what is new and what is already covered by existing NDC targets is challenging.\n",
    "For methane, signatories agreed to cut emissions in all sectors by 30% globally over the next decade. The coal exit initiative seeks to transition away from unabated coal power by the 2030s or 2040s and to cease building new coal plants. Signatories of the 100% EVs declaration agreed that 100% of new car and van sales in 2040 should be electric vehicles, 2035 for leading markets, and on forests, leaders agreed “to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) seeks to facilitate a managed phase-out of oil and gas production.\n",
    "NDCs should be updated to include these sectoral initiatives, if they’re not already covered by existing NDC targets. As with all targets, implementation of the necessary policies and measures is critical to ensuring that these sectoral objectives are actually achieved.\n",
    "- **Methane pledge**: Viet Nam is one of the signatories of Global Methane Pledge and committed to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared to the base year of 2020. Around 21% of Viet Nam’s emissions are from methane. Absolute methane emissions have been declining since 2011. Methane emissions mainly come from the agriculture sector. Viet Nam has planned to adopt advanced solutions in agriculture production to reduce methane emission from cultivation and husbandry. In August 2022, Viet Nam released its national methane emission reduction plan with the goal of reducing methane emissions by at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030.",
    "- **Coal exit**: During COP26, Viet Nam pledged to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants. Viet Nam’s coal capacity grew by around 57% between 2014 and 2021. The Vietnamese government adopted a plan to not develop new coal-fired power plants after 2030 and will gradually reduce its coal fleet after 2035. However, Viet Nam has a further 15.6 GW coal capacity in the pipeline – 7.4 GW under construction and 8.3 GW at pre-construction level. Viet Nam is exploring options to accelerate its phase-out of unabated coal power through the Just Energy Transition Partnership platform.",
    "- **100% EVs**: On 22 July 2022 Viet Nam adopted a green energy transition roadmap, the overall objective of this strategy is to develop a green transport system which will 100% operate through electricity or green energy by 2050 in consistent with its net zero target. With more than 87% of households owning a motorcycle there is a high potential for the electric two wheeler market in Viet Nam. The electric two wheeler fleet reached two million units at the end of 2022. Electric passenger vehicle market sales are still modest, at 8,400 units during the year 2022.",
    "- **Forestry**: In 2016, Viet Nam’s sink capacity was 39 MtCO2e/year. In its National Climate Change Strategy to 2050, Viet Nam set a target to maintain forest coverage at 43% and ensure the preservation of national forest areas; improve forest quality and sustainable forest management.",
    "- **Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance:** This alliance was created with the aim to restrict any kind of fossil fuel expansion by ending licensing of new projects and phasing out existing oil and gas projects. Viet Nam has not joined this alliance, and its gas expansion plans are at odds with the alliance’s goal.",
    "\n## Energy supply\n",
    "The energy sector emissions accounted for 60% of Viet Nam’s total emissions in 2021 (Gütschow et al., 2022a). Total final energy consumption grew 147% from 2010 to 2019 (IEA, 2021c). In the updated NDC, more than half of the emissions reduction through the decade come from this sector (Viet Nam Government, 2022a). After having achieved universal electrification in 2015, Viet Nam has experienced several energy challenges in recent years amid a context of high economic growth (World Bank, 2019).\n",
    "In 2023, a record-breaking heat wave resulted in a high demand for electricity and plunged the northern regions of Viet Nam into a major power outage, with losses amounting to 0.3% of GDP. Some businesses reported having loss up to 10% of their revenues (World Bank, 2023). These disruptions were primarily linked to the influence of El Nino, an exceptional drought, high fuel costs, the local dependence on hydropower and relatively lower adoption of wind and solar energy compared to other regions (World Bank, 2023).\n",
    "Viet Nam is already among the ten countries most affected by climate change (World Bank, 2023). The building of a clean, resilient energy system is crucial both for mitigating contribution to global warming and limiting its adverse consequences.\n",
    "**Coal power**With 23 GW of installed capacity in 2021, coal accounts for 30% of Viet Nam’s capacity mix. Although coal will keep playing a key role in the country’s power mix, with a capacity target of 30 GW by 2030 in the PDP8 (see Policy Overview section above), this new objective is a considerable improvement over the PDP7 goal of reaching 55.3 GW of coal-fired capacity by 2030 and 37 GW in the draft version of PDP8 (Energy Tracker Asia, 2022b; Viet Nam Government, 2021).\n",
    "With current policies, power generation from coal is expected to increase by 8-46% above 2021 levels through the decade, and decrease by 18% in case of a full and substantial implementation of the JETP. Coal will account for 22-30% of the generation mix in 2030 under current policies, and 16% in the case of a full and substantial implementation of the JETP, compared to 47% in 2021 (Ember, 2023).\n",
    "An increasing number of coal projects are already being cancelled in Viet Nam, mainly due to a lack of financial viability, with 45 GW of coal-fired projects shelved between 2010 and 2022 including one-fifth cancelled in 2021-2022 (Global Energy Monitor, 2021, 2022b). 7.3 GW of coal fired plants are still at the construction or pre-construction stages as of April 2023 (Global Energy Monitor, 2023).\n",
    "The PDP8 contains a list of coal-fired power projects that are encountering delays and/or financial difficulties, amounting to a total capacity of 7.2 GW not factored into the plan’s 2030 power mix structure. The PDP8 urges the Ministry of Industry and Trade to collaborate with investors to expedite the progress of these projects before June 2024, before considering termination.\n",
    "The PDP8 mentions converting plants older than 20 years into ammonia and biomass facilities, contingent on financial feasibility but without a specified price threshold. Such retrofitting presents substantial risks as it supports existing operations with uncertain reconversion prospects, thereby reducing the visibility of the coal phase-out timeline. Vietnamese climate and energy practitioners identified incomplete regulations as the primary barriers to coal power phase-out in Viet Nam, ahead of concerns regarding power supply security and electricity prices (Do & Burke, 2023).\n",
    "Viet Nam is a signatory of the global pledge to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation and stop construction of new plants (UN Climate Change Conference, 2021). The country is now receiving international support from the International Partners Group (IPG) through the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) platform which aims to accelerate its coal phase-out plan and to achieve net zero by 2050 (European Commission, 2022a).\n",
    "**Coal Supply**Domestic coal production has experienced a threefold increase over the span of two decades, in line with the fast growth in coal consumption over the same timeframe (Do & Burke, 2023). This expansion remains insufficient to satisfy the economy’s growing demand, leading Viet Nam to become a net coal importer in 2015.\n",
    "The Master Plan on National Energy aims at decreasing coal production from 48 million tonne per year (Mtpa) in 2021 to 41-47 Mtpa in 2030, 39 Mtpa by 2045 and 33 Mtpa by 2050 (Do & Burke, 2023; Government of Viet Nam, 2023). Imports are projected to increase from 55 Mt in 2021 to 73 Mtpa by 2030, 85 by 2035, before decreasing to 50 Mtpa by 2045 (Do & Burke, 2023; Government of Viet Nam, 2023). The ratio of domestically produced to imported coal will therefore shift from 46% in 2021 to 36-39% in 2030. In the seven first months of 2023, Viet Nam already spent over USD 4bn on imported coal (VietNamNet, 2023).\n",
    "The Master Plan on National Energy forecasts imports to suddenly drop from 50 Mtpa in 2045 to zero by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023b). While this is an ambitious goal, albeit too late to respect the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming under 1.5°C degrees, a complete elimination of coal imports within just five years might be overly optimistic and may not be realistically achievable, in contrast to a comprehensive and gradual planning of the transition.\n",
    "**Fossil gas**Fossil gas currently plays a minor role in Viet Nam’s energy system. It accounted for 6% of the primary energy consumption and 11% of power generation in 2021 (Energy Institute, 2023). However, Viet Nam is planning for a rapid growth in fossil gas consumption and will start importing LNG for power generation.\n",
    "The PDP8 and JETP focus on reducing coal-fired generation, compared to earlier plans, results in a subsequent increase in fossil gas-fired generation. The projected installed fossil gas capacity in 2030 has increased significantly between PDP7 to PDP8, from 19 GW in PDP7 to over 37 GW in the PDP8, compared to 8 GW in 2021 (Ember, 2023; Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "Viet Nam is planning to increase domestic production of gas up to 5.5-15 billion cubic metres per year by 2030, and 10-15 for 2031-2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023b). The domestic gas production was 7.2 billion cubic metres in 2021 (Energy Institute, 2023).\n",
    "Viet Nam’s fossil gas generation goals will necessitate fuel imports capacity of 16-18 billion cubic metres per year by 2030 and 11-13 by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023b). The share of LNG is going to be approximately 60% of the total fossil gas-fired power generation capacity (22.4 GW) at the end of the decade (Viet Nam Government, 2023a). In May 2023, the state-owned company PetroViet Nam Gas built the first LNG import terminal in the country (Enerdata, 2023). The current plans for the development of LNG terminals raise concerns that their capacity will not be sufficient to meet the demand implied by the PDP8. Viet Nam has not yet finalised any long-term LNG supply contract (Center on Global Energy Policy, 2023).\n",
    "Fossil gas is not a transition fuel and hinders progress towards reaching both national and international climate objectives (Climate Analytics, 2021). PDP8 further plans that gas plants project will be transitioned to hydrogen when financial conditions allow it, despite uncertainties regarding the mode of production of the hydrogen consumed.\n",
    "The massive efforts Viet Nam’s government is directing towards the gas sector development are not 1.5°C compatible and raise the spectre of significant stranded asset risks, with a phase-out timeline contingent upon the technological and economic viability of hydrogen as a fuel. Increasing dependency on imported energy will risk the country's vulnerability to energy security threats in a complex geopolitical landscape.\n",
    "**Renewable energy**In 2021, renewable energy sources accounted for 23% of the country's primary energy consumption and 43% of electricity production, including hydro (Energy Institute, 2023). Hydroelectricity generated 31% of Viet Nam’s electricity in 2021, compared to just 12% from other renewable sources, including wind and solar (Energy Institute, 2023).\n",
    "The PDP8 targets 31-39% of renewable power generation by 2030 (47% in the case of a “full and substantial implementation” of the JETP) and 68-72% by 2050. This represents a significant increase compared to the goals set in the 2022 National Climate Change Strategy, aiming to achieve a combined renewable energy capacity share, including hydro, of at least 33% of the electricity mix by 2030 and 55% by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2022d).\n",
    "The target set by the PDP8 is nevertheless underwhelming considering Viet Nam’s significant renewable potential, and the strong growth of rooftop solar PV deployment in the last few years. As per the PDP8, solar energy has a technical potential of 963 GW, onshore wind stands at 221 GW, and offshore wind is estimated at 600 GW (Viet Nam Government, 2023b). This represents a renewable energy potential that is more than twenty-four times larger than Viet Nam's installed power capacity in 2021 (Ember, 2023).\n",
    "The PDP8 targets indicate a slowing down of the deployment of photovoltaic panels, in contrast to the momentum of recent years. The PDP8 aims at deploying 6.7 GW of solar PVs (including rooftop solar) during the rest of the decade, while 12 GW have been installed between 2019 and 2020 (see section on solar energy). However, wind energy is anticipated to undergo rapid expansion, with a 2030 target of 27.9 GW compared to an installed capacity of 4.1 GW in 2021 (Ember, 2023; Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "In addition to the PDP8 and the 2022 National Climate Change Strategy, Resolution 55 supports policies to promote clean energy (Viet Nam Government, 2020). Resolution 55 includes a new renewable energy target for renewables to represent 15-20% in 2030 and 25-30% in 2045 in the total primary energy supply, in line with the targets from the Master Plan on National Energy (Viet Nam Government, 2020a, 2023b).\n",
    "**Solar**Solar PV deployment in Viet Nam has experienced rapid growth, particularly until 2021. At the end of 2021, the installed solar capacity was 16.7 GW, including 7.6 GW of rooftop solar (Ember, 2023).\n",
    "Through the PDP8, the government aims to achieve a target of 12.8 GW of solar power capacity (excluding rooftop solar), representing 8.5% of the total installed capacity by 2030. This target reflects a 41% increase compared to current levels. The share of solar capacity is then projected to rise to 35-37% by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "The government mentions the deployment of 2.6 GW of rooftop solar capacity throughout the decade but does not incorporate a targeted installed rooftop PV capacity in its forecasted 2030 power mix. The PDP8 also includes a goal of implementing rooftop solar systems for self-consumption in 50% of office buildings and 50% of houses, with the implementation of net metering systems (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "Viet Nam added more solar power capacity than all other ASEAN countries combined in 2020 (Ember, 2022). Between 2019 and 2020, Viet Nam's solar capacity increased by 11.7 GW (EVN, 2021). The solar boom experienced in Viet Nam can be attributed to a well-designed policy mix, which includes generous feed-in-tariffs and the exemption of renewable energy producers from income tax, import tariffs, and land lease payments. Viet Nam accomplished its 2025 solar targets as early as 2020 (Ember, 2022). The average investment cost and levelised cost of energy for solar in Viet Nam are the lowest among the ASEAN countries, at respectively USD 690 per KW and USD 0.046 per kWh (IRENA, 2022).\n",
    "Although the policies implemented have been successful at driving investment in Viet Nam’s renewable energy sector, the lack of planning in transmission and distribution resulted in a severe grid failure (GREENCIC, 2023). Viet Nam's solar PVs boom has led the National Load Dispatch Centre to announce a pause in new renewable capacity deployments in 2022 (IUCN, 2022).\n",
    "The solar deployment has been concentrated in the centre and south of the country, with solar energy comprising over 60% of installed capacity in some regions (IUCN, 2022). The lack of accurate production forecasts contributes to the challenges experienced by the grid (VNEEC, 2023a). Prioritising the fast-tracking of approvals and investments in upgrading the power grid’s transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as fostering interconnectivity among regions are key to maximise the potential of renewables (World Bank, 2023).\n",
    "**Hydro**Hydro power is the largest source of renewable energy in Viet Nam, representing 16% of the primary energy supply and 31% of the electricity generation mix in 2021 (Ember, 2023; Energy Institute, 2023). The riverscapes of Viet Nam are among the most exploited in the world (Sasges & Ziegler, 2023).\n",
    "The PDP8 reiterates Viet Nam's commitment to harnessing the full potential of its hydro resources. The projected total hydro capacity is expected to reach 29 GW in 2030 and 36 GW in 2050, which signifies a significant increase from the 22 GW capacity recorded in 2021 (Ember, 2023). According to the National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam will pursue the development of small hydro plants that adhere to environmental protection standards, while also expanding medium and large-scale hydroelectric projects (Viet Nam Government, 2022b).\n",
    "Climate change risks disrupt water flows, intensify seasons, and heighten evaporation, directly impacting Viet Nam's hydroelectric production. The 2023 droughts caused the water levels in multiple reservoirs around the country to drop below the levels required for turbine operations (Asia News Network, 2023). The mean hydropower capacity factor in Mainland Southeast Asia is set to drop by 6-8% below 1970-2000 levels by the end of the century (IEA, 2021a).\n",
    "**Wind**Although not as generous as those for solar power, the implementation of feed-in-tariff mechanisms specifically designed for wind energy sources has still attracted new investments in wind power projects (Do et al., 2021). The installed onshore capacity reached 4.1 GW at the end of 2021 (Ember, 2023). The PDP8 targets a deployment of 21.9 GW by 2030 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "Viet Nam's vast coastlines offer substantial potential for offshore wind energy, estimated at 600 GW in the PDP8. The plans outlined in the PDP8 include a target of 6 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. The total wind power capacity is expected to increase to 130-169 GW by 2050, with 70-92 GW of offshore wind (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "\n## Industry\n",
    "Industrial process emissions are mainly from cement production, followed by steel and ammonia production (MNRE, 2019). This sector is projected to be the second largest in terms of emissions by 2030 based on the current policy pathway. It is also set to be the sector with the biggest health impact (EREA & DEA, 2021). Viet Nam’s first NDC excluded industrial process emissions, but its 2020 and 2022 NDC updates did (Viet Nam Government, 2022a).\n",
    "In 2015, the Minister of Industry and Trade approved the Green Growth Action Plan 2015-2020 for the industry sector, and the Ministry of Construction has an action plan until 2020 to reduce cement industry GHG emissions (MNRE, 2019). The plan aims to reduce emissions by 20 MtCO2e by 2020 and 164 MtCO2e by 2030 compared to BAU levels (MNRE, 2019). The policy targets energy-related emissions, but not process-related emissions.\n",
    "The Viet Nam National Energy Efficiency Program 3 (VNEEP3) sets energy efficiency targets for the industry sector, to reduce 2030 average energy consumption in subsectors compared to 2015-2018 levels (MOIT, 2019). For instance, the chemical industry has a target to reduce average energy consumption by at least 10%, and the cement industry has a target to reduce average energy consumption to produce one tonne of cement from 87kgOE in 2015 to 81 kgOE in 2030 (MOIT, 2019). VNEEP3 sets targets for newly built industrial parks to apply energy efficiency and conservation solutions by 2025 among other targets (MOIT, 2019).\n",
    "\n## Transport\n",
    "The transport sector accounted for 23% of Viet Nam's total final energy consumption in 2018 (APEC, 2022). In July 2022, Viet Nam adopted a roadmap for the transition to green energy in the transport sector, with electrification and use of green energy, targeting 100% of clean transportation by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2022c).\n",
    "In the urban transport sector, this roadmap sets the goal that by 2025 new buses will be using electricity or green energy, that all new taxis will be electric vehicle by 2030, and that 100% buses and taxis will be either electrified or will use green energy by 2050. This roadmap includes interim targets for electrification of railways and shipping. Battery electric vehicles are already exempt from registration fees from three years starting March 2022 (Le & Posada, 2022).\n",
    "The roadmap promotes blending and use of E5 gas for 100% of road motor vehicles. The government has a roadmap to mix A92 gasoline with at least 5% bioethanol, and compulsory energy labelling for LDVs and motorcycles.\n",
    "Two wheelers are the main mode of transport in Viet Nam, meeting 73% and 82% of the travel demand in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (Le & Posada, 2022). As of 2022, the registered number of two wheelers had already reached 65 million and roughly two-thirds of the population own a motorcycle (Nguyen, 2022). Viet Nam is the second largest electric two wheeler market in the world, after China (MotorcyclesData, 2022). As of the end of 2022, there were two million electric two wheelers on Viet Nam’s roads, accounting for close to 3% of the national fleet (Viet Nam News, 2023).\n",
    "Sales of electric vehicles (EV) are modest, reaching 8,400 units in 2022. EV penetration is at the same level as two wheelers, at 2.9% (CNBC, 2023). The manufacture and adoption of electric vehicles have been given preferential treatment by the Vietnamese government (Le et al., 2022b).\n",
    "To reduce energy use of this sector the National Strategy for Climate Change to 2050 includes measures for restructuring the transport market, including the transition from road transport to inland waterway and coastal transport; make the transition from road to railway, increase railway goods transport percentage; increase transport efficiency via building and expanding road network (Viet Nam Government, 2022b).\n",
    "\n## Buildings\n",
    "Energy demand in the building sector has risen in the past decade as result of Viet Nam’s successful implementation of universal electrification and increase in use of electrical home appliances (APEC, 2022; APERC, 2019). In recent times use of biomass has seen a significant drop because of increase electrification (APEC, 2022). The residential sector accounts for 18% of the total final energy consumption in 2017 (IEA, 2019).\n",
    "The government has introduced some energy efficiency policies, including the VNEEP3 (MOIT, 2019). An official Prime Minister Decision (No.04/2017/QD-TTg) in 2017 sets out mandatory energy labelling and minimum energy efficiency standards roadmap for equipment and appliances (MOIT, 2019). In the National Green Growth Strategy there are specific tasks relating to the development of green buildings, and energy efficiency of buildings (MNRE, 2019).\n",
    "\n## Agriculture\n",
    "In 2021, agriculture represented 18% of Viet Nam’s GHG emissions (Gütschow et al., 2022a). A decision by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development approved a programme to reduce GHG emissions in the agriculture sector to 2020, promoting low carbon agriculture (MNRE, 2019). As per the Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan, the objective is to limit methane emissions from agriculture, setting goals to limit cultivation emissions to 30.7 (42.2) MtCO2e and animal husbandry emissions to 15.2 (16.8) MtCO2e by 2030 (2025) (Viet Nam Government, 2022c).\n",
    "The National Strategy for Climate Change to 2050 calls for a 43% emissions reduction from this sector from its 2030 BAU level and limit the emissions at 64 MtCO2e by 2030 from current level of 78 MtCO2e (Gütschow et al., 2022a). Under broad measures and action in the agricultural sector this strategy has also proposed promoting agricultural restructuring, adopting smart agricultural solutions adapting to climate change and utilising advantages of tropical agriculture and develop organic agriculture. In the short run until 2030, Viet Nam’s focus would be on shifting cultivar and domestic animal compositions to smartly adapt to climate change while securing food supply of its population.\n",
    "\n## Forestry\n",
    "Viet Nam’s land use, land use change and forestry sector is currently a net sink. Viet Nam’s LULUCF sector is intended to play a large role in meeting Viet Nam’s updated NDC. Under the government reported business-as-usual scenario (BAU), the LULUCF sector is estimated to be a sink of 49 MtCO2e in 2030 (Viet Nam Government, 2022a).\n",
    "In its 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, Viet Nam has set a target for land use and forestry sector to reduce 70% of emission and increase 20% of carbon absorption and achieve a total sink capacity of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. It also includes maintaining forest coverage at 43% and improve forest quality and sustainable forest management (Viet Nam Government, 2022d).\n",
    "The 2017 Law on Forestry regulates the management of forests, and notes that an assessment is needed to limit forest loss and conserve the forests (MNRE, 2019). The National Action Programme on the Reduction of GHG Emissions Reduction of Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Sustainable Management of Forest Resources, and Conservation and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+) by 2030, was approved in 2017 (MNRE, 2019).\n",
    "\n## Waste\n",
    "In 2021, the waste sector represented 5% of Viet Nam’s GHG emissions excluding LULUCF (Gütschow et al., 2022a). In 2018 the Prime Minister approved the National Strategy for General Management of Solid Waste to 2025 with a 2050 vision, which included energy recovery and GHG reduction (MNRE, 2019).\n",
    "According to the 2050 National Climate Change Strategy, the emissions reduction from the waste sector would be 61% by 2030 and 91% by 2050. This is supported by policy plans such as implementing solutions for managing and reducing waste from production to consumption, expand responsibilities of manufacturers; increase reuse and recycling of waste.\n",
    "Viet Nam will also adopt advanced solutions in treating wastes and wastewater to reduce methane emissions (Viet Nam Government, 2022d). The Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan includes the goal of cutting methane emissions from solid waste management and wastewater treatment by 13% at 22 MtCO2e by 2025, and by 30% at 17.5 MtCO2e by 2030, compared to an implied 2020 baseline level of 25.3 MtCO2e (Viet Nam Government, 2022c).\n",
    "The PDP8 promotes power generation through organic and solid waste combustion, with estimated potentials of 7 GW and 1.8 GW. The plan aims for 2.3 GW by 2030 and 6 GW by 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "Endorsed through a resolution in June 2022, the Circular Economic Development Project strives to cut GHG intensity as part of the GDP by 15% below 2014 levels by 2030. It sets a target reutilising, recycling, and treating 85% of plastic waste, alongside a 50% reduction in plastic waste releases in the oceans. The project establishes objectives of capturing and managing 50% of solid waste in urban areas, achieving complete organic waste treatment in urban regions, and attaining 70% in rural zones (Viet Nam Government, 2022a).\n",

    "# Assumptions",
    "\n## Historical emissions\n",
    "Historical emissions for the period 1990-2021 are from PRIMAPhist dataset (for energy, industry, agriculture and waste) (Gütschow et al., 2022a).\n",
    "Energy emissions for 2022 are calculated using CO2 emissions growth rate data from the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy 2023 (Energy Institute, 2023). Industry’s emissions for 2022 have been estimated using GDP growth rate. We used the 5-year trend (2017-2021) to estimate emissions for the agriculture, waste and other sectors.\n",
    "LULUCFLULUCF data is from the third Biennial Update Report (Viet Nam Government, 2020b). These estimates are calculated using global warming potential (GWP) values from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). We have not converted these into AR4 values assuming contribution from non-CO2 gases is negligible.\n",
    "\n## NDC target\n",
    "BAUThe BAU emissions are from Viet Nam’s 2022 updated NDC (Viet Nam Government, 2022a). The BAU scenario for GHG emissions assumes “medium economic development” and corresponding energy demand. The pledge emissions have economy wide coverage. The BAU starts from 2014 inventory data, with projections for 2020, 2025 and 2030.\n",
    "NDCThe 2022 updated NDC provides a breakdown of sectoral emissions reduction in GWP AR4 in 2030. We sum up the reduction amount from energy, agriculture, waste and industry in 2030 and subtracted these from BAU emissions in 2030 to derive the NDC targets.\n",
    "The CAT methodology for rating NDCs is based on GHG emissions from fossil fuels. We exclude the LULUCF sector from our calculations. For more information, please refer to the CAT methodology section.\n",
    "\n## Current policy projections\n",
    "Power CO2 emissionsThe emission estimates from the 8th Power Development Plan (PDP8) are based on coal and gas emissions factors derived from the IEA’s Emissions Factors for Viet Nam, and the plan’s power sector emissions targets (204-254 MtCO2e in 2030). The yearly coal and gas generation is interpolated to 2030 by taking into account the combined domestic gas and LNG-fired generation values of 157 TWh by 2030 mentioned in the plan, aligning with the overall emissions targets for 2030 (IEA, 2021b; Viet Nam Government, 2023a). The percentage of coal generation within the 2030 power mix was determined based on the anticipated 2030 generation value of 567 TWh included in the PDP8 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "For post-2030, sectoral current policy projections were interpolated with the 2050 power sector emissions range included in the PDP8. The upper bound of the current policies power sector emissions projections coincides with the upper bound of the range indicated in the PDP8. The lower bound of the current policy projections was calculated using the average of the growth rate of power sector emissions from both ends of the range included in the PDP8 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "Non power energy CO2 emissionsNon-power energy CO2 emissions are assumed to follow the same growth rate as in the APEC Energy Demand & Supply Outlook 2022 (APEC, 2022). The current policy projections takes into account the energy savings from the Viet Nam National Energy Efficiency Program 3, but do not include the World Bank funded Viet Nam Scaling Up Energy Efficiency Project which would further reduce energy demand (APEC, 2022).\n",
    "Non-CO2 emissionsThe emissions of energy related non-CO2 greenhouse gases, agriculture and the waste sector are based on non-CO2 emissions projection of US-EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2019).\n",
    "For the lower end of industrial emissions, we assume that the last historical year (2021) growth rate will continue, and for the upper end we assume average growth rate of the last 5 years (2017-2021) will continue.\n",
    "\n## Planned policy projections\n",
    "In the PDP8, the JETP targets are included separately to the domestic targets, with the specific mention that the JETP-related objectives are to be met conditionally on a fully and substantial implementation of the Partnership by international partners. The Resource Mobilisation Plan, detailing the implementation of the mobilisation required for the implementation of the JETP, is expected to be released in November 2023 (European Commission, 2022a).\n",
    "Hence, we have accounted the Planned Policy projections as the emissions that would result from a scenario where the “commitments under JETP are fully and substantively implemented by international partners” (Viet Nam Government, 2023a). The method used for determining power CO2 emissions in the Current Policies scenario was applied in the Planned Policy scenario, using the 170 MtCO2e target instead of the domestic ones. For post-2030, power sector emissions are interpolated to the lower end of the range included in the PDP8 (Viet Nam Government, 2023a).\n",
    "\n## Net-zero target\n",
    "Viet Nam's National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) establishes emission limits for each sector by the year 2050: the energy sector is set at 101 MtCO2e, agriculture at 56 MtCO2e , industrial processes at 20 MtCO2e , and waste at 8 MtCO2e . These sectors collectively will amount to 185 MtCO2e of residual emissions by 2050. Additionally, the Vietnamese governments assumes negative emissions from the LULUCF sector of 185 MtCO2e by 2050, resulting in a net zero emissions outcome by 2050. For this reason, we assume 185 MtCO2e of residual emissions remaining in Viet Nam’s net-zero target year of 2050.\n",
    "The NCCS, however, does not explicitly mention the global warming potential (GWP) utilized for estimating emissions. According to the NCCS, the percentage reduction targets from BAU emissions for each sector, aiming for net zero by 2050, are as follows: energy sector 91.6%, agriculture 63.1%, industrial processes 84.8%, waste 90.7%, and LULUCF at 90%. We have validated these percentage reduction figures against BAU emissions in GWP AR4, as indicated in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of 2022 (Viet Nam Government, 2022a).\n",
    "\n## Global warming potentials\n",
    "The CAT uses Global Warming Potential (GWP) values from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for all its figures and time series.\n",
    "\n---\n",
    "# Targets",
    "\n## Target Overview\n",
    "In 2022 Viet Nam submitted its updated NDC, increasing its unconditional target to reduce GHG emissions by 15.8% below business-as-usual levels (BAU) by 2030 compared to 9% in the previous NDC. Conditional on international support, this target will be further increased to 43.5% below BAU, higher than previous conditional target of 27%. The conditional target is cumulative. GHG emissions reduction from international support alone are 28% from 2030 BAU emissions.\n",
    "The updated unconditional and conditional targets translate to 863 and 620 MtCO2e/yr, respectively, in terms of absolute emissions levels for 2030 or 12% and 37% below BAU, excluding the land use and forestry sector.\n",
    "The updated NDC claims that new targets are aligned to fulfill Viet Nam’s commitments at COP26, but it is not a true progression in scaling up climate action, as it is still aligned with 4ºC of warming and requires no additional effort beyond current policies. Notably, at COP26, Viet Nam committed to reach net zero by 2050 along with additional pledges related to a coal phase-out and methane emission reductions.\n",
    "In the updated NDC, Viet Nam has transparently presented the financial requirements to achieve its unconditional and conditional targets.\n",
    "The CAT rates Viet Nam’s targets as “Critically Insufficient”.\n",
    "\n## CAT rating of targets\n",
    "The CAT rates NDC targets against what a fair contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement’s long-term temperature goal would be as well as against indicative national emissions from global least-cost pathways that achieve the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal (called modelled domestic pathways).\n",
    "Viet Nam has put forward two targets in its NDC: one that it will achieve using its own resources (15.8% GHG emissions reduction from BAU) and one that is conditional on international support (43.5% GHG emissions reduction from BAU). We rate the country’s unconditional target against its fair share contribution and its conditional target against the level of reductions needed within its borders aligned with a global least cost pathway (modelled domestic pathway).\n",
    "Conditional NDC target against modelled domestic pathways\n",
    "We estimate that Viet Nam’s conditional target would result in an emissions level of 620 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, which we rate as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on Viet Nam’s modelled domestic pathway for a 1.5°C limit.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s conditional target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. If all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "With the NDC update, Viet Nam’s emission reductions under its conditional target have strengthened by 17% but are close to two times higher than the 1.5°C modelled domestic pathway (353 MtCO2e) for 2030. Substantial improvement is needed in this target. It is important that Viet Nam sets a stronger target to plan faster emissions reductions, and not lock itself into a high carbon future.\n",
    "Unconditional NDC target against fair share\n",
    "We estimate that Viet Nam’s unconditional target would result in an emissions level of 863 MtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) in 2030, which we rate as “Critically Insufficient”. This rating is based on Viet Nam’s fair share contribution at a 1.5°C limit.\n",
    "The “Critically insufficient” rating indicates that Viet Nam’s unconditional target reflects minimal to no action and is not at all consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Viet Nam’s target is not in line with any interpretation of fairness. If all countries were to follow Viet Nam’s approach, warming would exceed 4°C.\n",
    "With the NDC update Viet Nam’s emission reductions under its unconditional target have improved by only 4% and are around 2.5 times more than a 1.5˚C compatible faire share target (350 MtCO2e).\n",
    "\n## NDC updates\n",
    "Viet Nam submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC in November 2022 (Viet Nam Government, 2022a). This is the second update provided by Viet Nam: it also provided an update in 2020.\n",
    "In the updated NDC, Viet Nam increased its unconditional target to represent a 15.8% reduction below BAU in 2030, and a 43.5% reduction with international support.\n",
    "While numerically stronger, the emissions targets are still “Critically insufficient” and while Viet Nam is on track to achieving its unconditional component with its current policies, it will not drive further climate action. The CAT assessment therefore does not consider Viet Nam’s NDC update to be stronger than its previous submission.\n",
    "In line with its previous NDC, the updated NDC has transparently provided a sectoral breakdown of targets and policies. Viet Nam has also provided the detailed financial requirements to implement those policies to achieve the targets. Most of these measures are already laid out in the National Climate Change Strategy to 2050 (Viet Nam Government, 2022d).\n",
    "The updated NDC has also put forward a detailed implementation plan of the targets by improving policies and institutions, creating awareness and community engagement, capacity and technological development, financial mobility and enhanced international cooperation. A framework for monitoring and evaluation of the targets, which was presented in the previous NDC, is now part of revised Law on Environmental Protection 2020 through a new government regulation.\n",
    "Though measures and implementation in the updated NDC improved on transparency and clarity but with only a minor improvement on ambition.\n",
    "The BAU pathway in the updated NDC remains unchanged from previous 2020 NDC. The BAU scenario is developed based on “medium economic development” without clearly mentioning if it considers the dip in economic activities during pandemic.\n",
    "While Viet Nam has made some improvements to the structure of its NDC, it continued with incomplete gas coverage. Emissions of F-gases are negligible in Viet Nam and the updated NDC does not include full greenhouse gas coverage, excluding NF3, PFCs and SF6. These were stated as included in the first NDC, however, they are not mentioned in the technical report that underlies the first NDC.\n",
    "* Before September 2021, all CAT ratings were based exclusively on fair share and only assessed a country’s target.** We have updated these figures to include the latest 2030 BAU estimates to allow for comparability across estimates.\n",
    "**Analysis of earlier NDC developments:**\n",
    "- 11 December 2020: Viet Nam did not increase ambition",
    "\n## Net zero and other long-term target(s)\n",
    "Viet Nam announced a target to achieve net zero by 2050 target during the COP26 World Leaders' Summit in 2021. In July 2022, Viet Nam reiterated its commitment to reach net zero in the decision approving its National Climate Change Strategy, aimed at guiding its planning to achieve net zero by 2050. Viet Nam’s net zero target is conditional on international financial support. The CAT rates Viet Nam’s target as “Average”.\n",
