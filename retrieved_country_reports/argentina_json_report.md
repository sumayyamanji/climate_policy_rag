## Country: Argentina

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8337):**
> ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor. **  In November 2022, Argentina submitted a Long-term Strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a). Argentina had previously announced its aim to set a net zero CO2 target (“carbon neutrality”) by 2050 in its second NDC submitted in 2020 (Government of Argentina, 2020).

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8427):**
> For example, the government could set separate emission and reduction targets and clarify its accounting methodology for LULUCF. It could further improve transparency on its planning process, the use of tools such as pathway modelling and specific sectoral policy objectives to reach net zero. **For the full analysis click** **here****.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8217):**

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8225):**
> **Further information on how the CAT rates countries (against modelled domestic pathways and fair share) can be found** **here****. **   ## Net zero and other long-term target(s)  We evaluate the net zero target as: **Poor. **  In November 2022, Argentina submitted a long-term strategy (LTS) to the UNFCCC that includes a target to reach GHG neutrality by 2050 (Government of Argentina, 2022a).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8002):**
> Depending on how changes in subsidies affect total power demand, this could potentially have a significant impact on our emissions projections under current policies. The government is also considering a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in the power sector, but has not yet set out official plans (Government of Argentina, 2024c). ### Fossil gas  Argentina is sending **“Mixed Signals”** on fossil gas, which remains the largest source of electricity, accounting for 54% of power generation in 2024 (Ember, 2025).
