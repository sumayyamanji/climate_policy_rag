## Country: China

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8074):**
> As the LTS submission does not meet the majority of our criteria for a best-practice approach in LTS formulation, we keep China’s net-zero target evaluation as “Poor”. ## Net zero targets  ## Summary  We evaluate China’s net zero target as: **Poor**. China submitted its Mid-Century Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy (LTS) on October 28, 2021 to the UNFCCC, which contains the country’s commitment to reach “carbon neutrality before 2060”.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8270):**
> LULUCF). Our conservative scenario expects China’s emissions to peak before 2025, followed by a slight annual decline of 0.5% for the rest of the decade. An optimistic scenario, with accelerated renewable deployment and coal phase-down, suggests CO2 emissions could peak as early as 2023, with a steeper annual decline of 1%, resulting in an additional 5% emission reduction, or 750 MtCO2, by 2030.

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8045):**
> This projection, based on the median value of conservative and optimistic estimates from the two most binding energy-related NDC targets (peaking and carbon intensity targets), represents a 28% increase from 2010 levels. The country’s existing policies are set to overachieve the NDC targets for the share of non-fossil fuel consumption and the capacity of wind and solar power. This indicates potential for further raising these commitments.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8548):**
> To be compatible with a 1.5°C pathway, China would need to have shares of renewable electricity generation reach at least 79% in 2030; It stood at only 31% in 2023 (NBS of China, 2024). Globally, all countries will need to have 95–100% renewable electricity shares by 2050 to be 1.5°C-compatible (Climate Action Tracker, 2023). The unprecedented surge in renewable energy has significantly strained the electricity network, with solar power plants frequently unplugging to prevent system overloads (Bloomberg News, 2024a).

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.7947):**
> - **Improve the formulation and coverage of its climate targets** by setting an absolute economy-wide peaking target for greenhouse gas emissions as well as specific emission reduction targets for 2035. China’s existing peaking, carbon intensity, and non-fossil energy share targets are relative to economic growth or energy system developments, allowing the country to meet its NDC commitments while increasing emissions levels. The NDC and LTS targets do not directly cover non-CO2 greenhouse gases, which amount to 2.5 GtCO₂e/yr or almost 18% of China’s total emissions, although China has now pledged to include all GHGs in its 2035 NDC.
