## Country: New Zealand

### Question 1: Does the country have a net zero target, and if so, what year is the target set for?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8278):**
> These would need to be achieved in other sectors, in particular through full decarbonisation of energy and industry emissions by 2050. The net zero target has good legal architecture. However, in addition to biogenic methane, international aviation and shipping are outside of the target’s scope, and the government reserves the right to use international offset credits to meet the target.

### Question 2: Does the country have a multi-sector climate strategy that sets quantified sector-specific emission targets or projections for key sectors like Electricity, Transport, Industry, LULUCF/Agriculture, and any other fifth sector with significant emissions?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8470):**
> The energy sector emissions in 2021 are estimated using GDP growth rate from IMF as proxy (IMF 2022). For industry, agriculture, waste and other emissions, the pre-COVID 5 year trend (2015-2019) has been applied. ## NDC and other targets  Target emissions levels were calculated from New Zealand’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2020 (Ministry for the Environment 2022g).

### Question 3: Does the country have an energy efficiency law or a strategic framework for national energy efficiency, AND has it set an energy efficiency target (economy-wide or sectoral)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8366):**
> The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen. Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. A target of 50% renewables for total final energy consumption by 2035 is also announced as part of a goal to have a national Energy Strategy in place by 2024.

### Question 4: Has the country set a net zero electricity target aligned with 1.5°C (e.g., by 2035 for high-income, 2040 for China, 2045 for rest of world), or an equivalent economy-wide net zero commitment?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8500):**
> The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen. Other climate policy highlights include the renewable electricity target of 90% by 2025 and 100% by 2035.

### Question 5: Does the country have a carbon pricing mechanism in place (e.g., carbon tax or emissions trading system)?

**Answer/Evidence (Similarity: 0.8242):**
> The Emissions Trading Scheme, however, continues to exempt the country’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions – the agriculture sector – from a price on its methane emissions until 2025, despite original promises that it would cover all sectors. Agricultural methane emission reductions are now being discussed under a proposal released in June 2022. The scheme relies strongly on industry partnerships and trust, with results yet to be seen.
